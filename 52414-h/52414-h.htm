<h2 class="main">THE CHRISTIAN MYTHOLOGY.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">That Christianity, as to-day presented by the
orthodox, is far different from the Christianity promulgated by the
early fathers, few are so blinded as to doubt. Christianity, like all
other religions, came not into the world full-grown, but from the
simple conceptions of its early followers became gradually elaborated
by the introduction of pagan forms and customs until it supplanted its
early rivals and gave its adherents a compact and solid theology not
very different from that of its predecessors. However, before
considering the genealogy of Christianity, or its heirlooms from
paganism, let us turn our attention to what were presumably the
beginnings of the religious views of mankind.</p>
<p class="par">Probably the true source of that human characteristic
which is defined as the religious instinct and which is supposed to be
an elevating and moral agent, is to be found in the superstition which
originated in fear of the unknown. The first ages of human life were so
devoted to the animal needs that little attention was given to anything
else, but later the craving for protection and help from some power
greater than himself led primitive man <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>to look about him for
something to sustain and aid him in his struggle for existence.
Surrounded by natural phenomena of which he could give no explanation
satisfactory to his experience, he came to the conclusion that he was
in an environment permeated with bodiless intelligences who governed
these matters by supernatural power. Awed to fear by the inexplicable
workings of nature, he sought to propitiate the spiritual agencies by
bribes, and he did all things for them which he thought would be
agreeable to them to keep them in good-natured interest or indifference
toward him. And, naturally, he considered that what would be pleasing
to himself would be pleasing to them. Therefore, his offerings and his
conduct towards these spirits were such as he would have desired shown
toward himself. Death and its imitation, sleep, being the greatest
mysteries confronting him, he naturally began to consider the spirits
of the dead, with whom he seemed to have intercourse in his dreams, as
being influential factors in his career; and thus originated
ancestor-worship with its highly-developed rites and sacrifices, which
in a modified form still exists in the Roman church in the practice of
reading masses for the souls of the dead. At the same time, noticing
the great benefits derived from the warmth of the sun, to whose rays he
owed his subsistence and whose glorious and awful presence was
constantly before him, man began to feel grateful to that mighty power
which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>was the source of all his welfare, and, appreciating
that all terrestrial life depended upon it, he came to recognize it as
the great creative power.</p>
<p class="par">From such superstitious fear and weakness of primitive
man arose all those religious feelings which the pious call instinctive
and which have, through progress, evolution, and elaboration,
controlled certain races, and from whose union have arisen all the
religious systems that have ever flourished. Owing to the varied
influences of climate, environment, and racial character, the various
forms of worship predominating in different geographical situations
have naturally assumed different characteristics, but, when stripped of
their surrounding, and often enveloping rites, ceremonies, and
superficialities they may all be traced to the above-mentioned
fundamental sources.</p>
<p class="par">It is my intention to show, as briefly as possible, that
in the Christianity of to-day we have nothing new nor of vital
difference from what has always been taught and believed in the many
epochs of the past. In common with all religious systems, Christianity
has a hero&mdash;the personified sun-god of all time&mdash;who is of
obscure origin, who passes through various episodes common to all, who
is finally executed, and who rises once more to renewed power. In our
perusal of the subject, we shall first consider the life of Jesus as
taught by the Christian church; secondly, the dogmas affecting the
source of his power and the results of his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>influence;
and, thirdly, the rites and ceremonies with which his worship is
performed.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Some two thousand years ago there is said to have
appeared in the notoriously rebellious province of Galilee, the
headquarters of Hebrew radicalism, a wandering teacher called Jesus,
who passed from village to village expounding certain ethical and
socialistic ideas, which were condemned by the Roman government and
which resulted in this man&rsquo;s arrest and subsequent execution.
After his death, his various pupils continued to preach his theories,
and, separating, spread these ideas over various parts of the then
civilized world. These pupils, naturally, having a firm belief in their
former leader, and desiring to strengthen in every possible manner
their faith as well as to increase the number of their proselytes, and,
also, being themselves more or less affected by the ancient messianic
idea, did not deny Jesus more than mortal powers, and allowed certain
pagan theories of deity to creep into their faith. Later, when the
vicious and crafty Constantine found it advisable for political reasons
to adopt Christianity as the state religion, the great mass of Roman
worshipers merely transferred the attributes of their ancient deities
to the objects venerated by the new sect.</p>
<p class="par">There was nothing new in bestowing a divine origin on
Jesus. All the lesser gods of antiquity <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>were the sons of Zeus, and,
in later times, monarchs were accorded the same origin. It was a common
myth of all ancient peoples that numerous beings derived their birth
from other than natural causes. Virgins gave birth to sons without aid
of men. Zeus produced offspring without female assistance. Almost all
the extraordinary men that lived under the old heathen mythology were
reputed to have been the sons of some of the gods. The doctrine of the
virgin birth is perhaps one of the oldest of religious ideas; it is so
universal that its origin is impossible to trace. Therefore, no wonder
is excited when we find that most of the religious leaders have been of
celestial origin.</p>
<p class="par">Krishna, the Indian savior, was born of a chaste virgin
called Devaki, who, on account of her purity, was selected to become
the mother of God. Gautama Buddha was born of the virgin Maya and
&ldquo;mercifully left Paradise and came down to earth because he was
filled with compassion for the sins and miseries of mankind. He sought
to lead them into better paths, and took their sufferings upon himself
that he might expiate their crimes and mitigate the punishment they
must otherwise inevitably undergo.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The great father of gods and men sent a messenger from
heaven to the Mexican virgin, Sochiquetzal, to inform her that it was
the will of the gods that she should immaculately conceive a son.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>As a result she bore Quetzalcoatl, the Mexican
savior, who &ldquo;set his face against all forms of violence and
bloodshed, and encouraged the arts of peace.&rdquo; The Mexican god
Huitzilopochtli was likewise immaculately conceived by a woman who,
while walking in a temple, beheld a ball of feathers descending in the
air. She grasped this and placed it in her bosom. It gradually
disappeared and her pregnancy resulted. The Mexican Montezumas were
later supposed to have been immaculately conceived by a drop of dew
falling on the exposed breast of the mother as she lay asleep.</p>
<p class="par">The Siamese have a virgin-born god and savior whom they
call Codom; the Chinese have several virgin-born gods, one being the
result of his mother&rsquo;s having become impregnated by merely
treading on the toe-print of God; while the Egyptians bowed in worship
before the shrine of Horus, son of the virgin Isis.</p>
<p class="par">Setting aside the mythological interpretation of the
miraculous conception of Jesus and the theory that his history is
entirely fictitious, and viewing his birth from a natural human
standpoint, even admitting that he may have been a &ldquo;divinely
inspired man,&rdquo; a little better than any other human being, there
seems to be only one explanation for his peculiar conception as
recorded in <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%201">Luke i</a>.</p>
<p class="par">Some critics of the rational school have not failed to
notice a solution of the problem in the appearance of the angel Gabriel
and his private <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>interview with Mary (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%201:28-38">Luke i,
28&ndash;38</a>). Say they very pertinently, why may not some
libidinous young man, having become enamoured of the youthful wife of
the aged Joseph, and, knowing the prophecy of the messiah, have visited
the object of his desire in angelic guise and, having won her
confidence in this r&ocirc;le, gained those favors that produced the
miraculous birth? And such an explanation is not improbable when we
consider that it is an historical fact that young and confiding women
often resorted to the pagan temples at the instigation of the
unscrupulous, where they enjoyed the embraces of ardent but previously
unsuccessful lovers, under the impression that they were being favored
by deities.</p>
<p class="par">So those Christians whose reasoning powers will not
allow them to believe in the absurdity of an unnatural conception, and
whose superstitious adoration will not permit of their believing Mary
guilty of an intentional <i lang="fr">faux pas</i>, try in this manner
to reconcile the two, and declare Joseph the guilty man.</p>
<p class="par">According to the Gospels, Joseph, the husband, knowing
Mary to be with child, married her (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%201:18">Matt. i,
18</a>); but that is no reason for believing that he regarded the Holy
Ghost&rsquo;s responsibility for his wife&rsquo;s condition with faith.
He told of a dream in which he had been informed that such was the case
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%201:20-23">Matt.
i, 20&ndash;23</a>). He may have believed the dream, and he may not.
The most sensible view <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10"
name="pb10">10</a>]</span>is that he, &ldquo;being a just man,&rdquo;
took this method of preserving her reputation, and that he himself was
the actual parent. Having betrayed the girl, he honestly married her,
but, to defend her and himself from the accusation of a serious
misdemeanor among the Jews (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%2022">Deut. xxii</a>),
he invented the dream story to account for her unfortunate condition.
Girls have ever told improbable stories to explain like misfortunes.
Dan&aelig; concocted the shower of gold yarn; Leda preferred to accuse
herself of bestiality with a swan to acknowledging a lover, and Europa
blamed a bull. Modern damsels have invented more modern but just as
innocent agents.</p>
<p class="par">It would seem from the subsequent actions and words of
Mary that she must have forgotten that her son was miraculously
conceived of God, for we find her reproaching him for remaining in the
temple of Jerusalem to argue with the rabbis with, &ldquo;Son, why hast
thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father and I have sought thee
sorrowing&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=

we are told that &ldquo;Joseph and his mother marveled at those things
which were spoken of him&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%202:33">Luke ii,

him as &ldquo;the Son of the Highest, who shall reign over the house of
Jacob forever&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%201:32-33">Luke i,

mother <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=

the temple (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%202:22-24">Luke ii,
22&ndash;24</a>) to be purified from the stains of her childbirth.
Women, having borne natural children, were considered to have become
defiled in the act of parturition, through the contact of the
perpetually active agency of original sin, whereof they must be
purified. The mere fact of her submitting to such a churching is
evidence that Mary did not know that she had done anything remarkable
in bearing Jesus, and was ignorant of an unusual conception.</p>
<p class="par">Their neighbors, despite the dream, always recognized
Jesus as Joseph&rsquo;s son (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

Nicodemus i, 2). The orthodox explain this on the supposition that
Joseph and Mary kept all these things in their hearts, and did not tell
the actual facts of the case, which seems unlikely. Joseph would want
to explain the early birth of Jesus, and Mary would be desirous of
saving her reputation, and both would naturally boast of the honor
conferred by the Holy Ghost, had they known of it, for in such case
Joseph&rsquo;s relation to his god was the same as that of the peasant
to his seigneur in the days of the <i lang="la">jus prim&aelig;
noctis</i>. The liaison was an honor, and would have been related to
save Jesus from the disagreeable allusions made by his neighbors

<p class="par">Conforming to the narrations of the miraculous
conception in Luke, Mary, and the Protevangelion, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>is an
old miracle play called &ldquo;Joseph&rsquo;s Jealousy,&rdquo; in which
we find a very natural picture of the good old husband discovering a
condition in his wife for which he is not responsible and accusing her
in plain old English of adorning his brow with antlers. The following
is the dialogue as given in Hone&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ancient Mysteries
Described&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker"><i>Jos.</i></p>

<p class="par">Mary tries to explain and says that her child is from
God alone and that she was so informed by an angel. The suspicious
Joseph will not be deceived, and gives way to some words that have
since been accepted as a true explanation of the miraculous
conception:</p>

<p class="par">The old prophecy in Isaiah (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%207:14">vii, 14</a>)
that a virgin shall bear a son loses its utility when we recognize that
this was the sign given Ahaz that God would preserve his kingdom,
although he was then threatened by a coalition of the kings of Ephraim
and Syria. If the prophecy referred to the Christ, how could it have
any influence on Ahaz? How could he be calmed and made to preserve his
courage in the face of danger by a sign which would not be given until
centuries after he slept with his fathers? But such was not the case.
Isaiah made his sign appear as he had promised (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%207:16">vii, 16</a>),
&ldquo;Before the child shall know to refuse evil, and choose the good,
the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings&rdquo;
(the rulers of Israel and Syria). Now, this prophecy <i>was</i>
fulfilled, either by the trickery of the prophet or the compliance of a
virgin, for we find in the next chapter (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%208:3">Isaiah viii,
3</a>), &ldquo;And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived and
bare a son.&rdquo; And that is the whole story. To apply it to the
mythical birth of Jesus is puerile. No one can doubt that so good a Jew
as Josephus believed in the prospect of a messiah, yet so little did
Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy impress him that he did not even mention the
virgin episode. Probably, on the whole, he thought it a rather
contemptible bit of trickery and rather detrimental to the memory of
Isaiah.</p>
<p class="par">James Orr, in his treatise written expressly to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>prove the historical fact of the virgin birth,
denies that the prophecy of Isaiah could be applied to Jesus. Here we
have an orthodox writer who firmly believes in the miraculous
conception, shattering the great cornerstone of the church&rsquo;s
foundation for this belief. He says that the word &ldquo;almah&rdquo;
was not Hebrew for virgin at all, but meant only a marriageable young
woman. He says it can have no connection with Jesus, and thus he agrees
with Thomas Paine, but for opposite reasons.</p>
<p class="par">While Orr evidently considers that all pagan tales of
divine paternity are legends, he affirms that the case of Jesus is
genuine. Just why God became Deus Genetrix only once, he does not
explain. If God approved of this method of creation, he would surely
have performed it more than once. That he should have chosen a woman at
all seems strange, when he could have produced Jesus without female
assistance. Why should he have given his son, coexistent with the
father, and, as such, undoubtedly of a fully developed intelligence,
all the discomfort and danger of infantile life? If Jesus were but
another phase of the godhead, one of the divine eternal trinity, it was
degrading and ridiculous to have inflicted him with the processes of
f&oelig;tal life, with all the embryonic phases of development from
ovule, through vertebrate and lower form to human guise; to have given
him the dangers of human gestation and parturition, the inconvenience
of childhood, with teething and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15"
href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>other infantile discomforts, and
the slow years of growth. Why did he inflict all these things on a
part, a third, of himself, in many years of preparation for but a few
years of preaching, when he could have produced the Christ in a
wonderful manner, full grown in all the beauty and dignity and strength
of perfect and sublime manhood? Probably some will answer that then
Jesus would have been regarded as an impostor. But no more doubt could
be cast on such an appearance than has been thrown on the doubtful
story of the purity of Mary. Orr, in his haste to prove his belief,
gives a very good argument against it (page 82) in the words,
&ldquo;The idea of a Virgin birth ... was one entirely foreign to
Jewish habits of thought, which honored marriage, and set no premium on
virginity.&rdquo; Therefore, it could not have been of Jewish origin.
The Jews never accepted it, and it grew up only under the influence of
Gentile converts.</p>
<p class="par">It was an idea of classic paganism, an adoption of
universal phallism, this conception of a divine impregnation. The
doctrine that by conjunction with a woman, God begat the Christ is
merely another phase of the phallic idea of the procreative principles
of the deity&mdash;it is another form of the <i lang="la">deus
genetrix</i>, the generative principle of male procreation.

of the pagan conceptions of an immaculate mother-queen of heaven, these
simple and natural consequences of her marriage could not be tolerated,
even allowing for the exceptional conception of Jesus, and the orthodox
began to assert that Mary was not only an uncontaminated virgin at the
birth of Jesus, but that by miracle she did not lose her virginity by
that event. They attempted to explain the above references, first, by
asserting that these children were of Joseph by a previous marriage,
and later, when they felt it necessary to endow the consort of their
pure mother with perfect celibacy, they named them as cousins only.
Jerome was so strong a champion for Joseph&rsquo;s virginity
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=

<p class="par">At the time of Jesus&rsquo; birth a brilliant star is
believed to have heralded the event, and has passed into tradition as
&ldquo;the star of Bethlehem.&rdquo; There is nothing novel in this
idea, as all ancient peoples were very superstitious about the
celestial bodies, firmly believing in astronomical influences on human
affairs, and it seems to have been a common idea that the births of
great men were announced by the presence of peculiar stars.</p>
<p class="par">In China, a new star appeared at the birth of Yu,
founder of the first dynasty, as was also the case when the sage
Laoutze was born, while in Mexico the &ldquo;morning star&rdquo; was
the symbol of the national savior Quetzalcoatl. The primitive
Christians, however, did not have to look so far for such an idea, but
easily found a parallel in the unusual star reported by the friends of
Terah to have appeared on the night of Abraham&rsquo;s birth, which
they said shone so brightly in the east.</p>
<p class="par">Not only was the birth of the messiah announced by the
brilliant star, but it was also celebrated by the singing of the
heavenly host. Similar phenomena <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18"
href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>occurred at the birth of
Krishna, when &ldquo;the clouds emitted low pleasing sounds and poured
down a rain of flowers.&rdquo; On the eve of the birth of Confucius
&ldquo;celestial music sounded in the ears of his mother&rdquo;; at
Buddha&rsquo;s a &ldquo;marvelous light illumined the earth&rdquo;; and
at the birth of Osiris a voice was heard proclaiming that the ruler of
the earth was born.</p>
<p class="par">The savior having been born, he must necessarily be
recognized, so the myth of the wise men and their gifts
follows&mdash;in a fashion very similar to that told of the other
saviors. The marvelous infant Buddha was visited at the time of his
birth by wise men who immediately recognized in him all the
characteristics of divinity. At the time of Confucius&rsquo; birth
&ldquo;five celestial sages entered the house whilst vocal and
instrumental music filled the air.&rdquo; Mithras, the Persian savior,
was visited by wise men called magi at the time of his birth, and was
presented by them with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh; and the
same story is told by Plato in relation to the birth of Socrates.</p>
<p class="par">While it is claimed for all the world&rsquo;s saviors
that they were borne by virgins and begotten by God, genealogies of
royal descent are traced for them through the husbands of their mothers
in a most illogical manner. As may be seen in the New Testament, the
pedigree of Jesus is most elaborately set forth in both Matthew and
Luke, who claim that through Joseph (whose parentage is denied)
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>the Christ was a direct descendant of King David,
though, strange to relate, the connecting generations are different in
one inspired gospel from what they are in the other. Krishna, in the
male line, was of royal descent, being of the house of Yadava, the
oldest and noblest of India; and Buddha was descended from Maha
Sammata, the first monarch of the world<span class="corr" id="xd21e528"
title="Source: ..">.</span></p>
<p class="par">Therefore, it is not surprising to find a royal pedigree
for the god Christ, especially when the religious position occupied by
the king in rude societies is considered. The Kaffres acknowledge no
other gods than their monarch, and to him they address those prayers
which other nations are wont to prefer to the supreme deity. Every
schoolboy knows of the apotheosis of the Roman emperors, and the
monarchs of Mexico and Peru were regarded as divinities. Every king of
Egypt was added to the list of gods and declared to be the son of Ra,
and even, in some cases, was made the third person of a trinity. Each
denied that he owed his birth to the father from whom he inherited the
crown, and claimed to have been miraculously begotten. Special temples
were erected for the worship of the kings, which was conducted by
special priests. The Parthian rulers of the Arsacid house, likewise,
claimed divinity and styled themselves brothers of the sun and
moon.</p>
<p class="par">The fable of the slaughter of the innocents, which was
merely a new form of the ancient myth of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>dangerous child whose life is a constant menace to
some tyrant, was copied from several ancient religions, and the flight
of the holy family into Egypt has its counterpart in other tales. King
Kansa sought the life of Krishna and sent messengers to kill all
infants in the neighboring places, but a heavenly voice warned his
foster-father to fly with him across the river Jumna, which was
immediately done. Salivahana, a virgin-born savior anciently worshiped
in southern India, had a similar experience; and fable tells that at
Abraham&rsquo;s birth Nimrod sought his life, fearing a prophecy that a
child was born who should overthrow his power, and, as a result, he
murdered 70,000 newly-born male children. At the time of Moses&rsquo;
birth, Pharaoh is said to have dreamed that a new-born child would
cause Egypt&rsquo;s ruin, and he ordered that all the new-born sons of
Israel should be cast into the Nile. Similar stories, familiar to all
readers of the classics, are told of Perseus, Herakles, Paris, Jason,
Bacchus, Romulus and Remus.</p>
<p class="par">All these tales of the birth and early life of Jesus are
similar to those of the other and more ancient saviors, and so is the
story of the temptation and the forty days&rsquo; fast. Moses fasted
&ldquo;forty days and forty nights&rdquo; on the mount where he
received the law (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

nights&rdquo; (Protevangelion i, 6, 7). Buddha fasted and held his
breath until he became extremely weak, when Mara, Prince of Evil,
appeared and tempted him to break his fast by offering to make him
emperor of the world. Quetzalcoatl was also tempted by the devil during
a forty days&rsquo; fast; and the temptation of Zoroaster forms the
subject of many legends.</p>
<p class="par">All these myths readily implanted themselves in the
Christian mythology, but the execution of its hero gave a great
opportunity for mythical expansion and elaboration.</p>
<p class="par">It is taught that Jesus was crucified; whether he was or
not nobody knows, although there are more pieces of the &ldquo;true
cross&rdquo; extant than could ever have flourished as trees on Mount
Calvary.</p>
<p class="par">If such a person as Jesus of Nazareth ever lived and was
ever executed by the Romans, it is very probable that he was hanged,
and the gallows may, very likely, have been of a form similar to that
of a rude cross. The term crucifixion does not necessarily imply that
one must be nailed outspread upon a symmetrical cross. It was the
ancient custom to use trees as gibbets for execution, or a rude
cruciform gallows, often called a &ldquo;tree&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%2021:22-23">Deut. xxi,
22, 23</a>; Nicodemus ix, 10). To be hung on such a cross was anciently
called hanging on a tree, and to be hung on a tree was crucifixion.
This rough method of execution was later modified by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>the
Christians to the present theory of the crucifixion, as they very
naturally desired to appropriate the cross for their own especial
emblem, owing to the fact that its great antiquity as a universal
religious symbol would aid in the propagation of their faith, and since
its earliest inception, Christianity has been ever prone to aid its
proselyting by the adoption of pagan dogmas, symbols and practices from
the so-called heathen theologies.</p>

<p class="figureHead">THE CRUX ANSATA.</p>
<p class="par first">This figure is as useful a key to religious
symbolism as the triangle is to plane geometry. In its outlines are
involved the cross, the trinity, and the male and female principles of
creation. It is the mitre of the pope, the crucifix, and the key, and
is seen in the vestments of the ancient Romish confessor. The modern
pallium of the priest preserves only the suggestion of the female,
appropriate to his feminine apparel&mdash;lace, painted garments, and
millinery.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Of all religious symbols, the cross is the most ancient
and sacred. It has from the earliest antiquity been the mystic emblem
for reverence and awe, and appears to have been in the aboriginal
possession of every ancient people. Populations of essentially
different culture, tastes, and pursuits have vied with one another in
their superstitious adoration of it. Greek crosses of equal arms
adorned the tomb of Midas of Phrygia; and long before the time of the
Eutruscans, the inhabitants of northern Italy erected crosses over the
graves of their dead. The cross was common to Mexico; white marble
crosses were found on the island of Saint Ulloa by its discoverers; and
it was greatly revered in Paraguay and Peru.</p>
<p class="par">While the origin of the cross, shrouded as it is in the
mists of the remotest antiquity, has been the subject of much
speculation which has resulted in numerous theories, it is,
undoubtedly, a conventionalized result of primitive phallic ideas.
Sexual motives underlie and permeate all known religious <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>systems.
The idea of a creative god naturally gave rise to characteristic
symbolical expression of the male and female principles, which were
gradually modified and reduced to the tau (a Gothic T), representing
the male principle, and the ring, representing the female principle. As
a complete expression of the creative power, these two symbols were
often placed in conjunction; and the most ancient form of the
conjunction was, probably, that of the <i lang="la">crux ansata</i>,
known to the Egyptians as &ldquo;the emblem of life,&rdquo; which was
very simply formed by placing the ring above the T. This emblem is
sometimes called the &ldquo;cross with the handle,&rdquo; because in
ancient sculpture it is often represented as being carried by the ring.
(See Doane, &ldquo;Bible Myths&rdquo;; Inman, &ldquo;Ancient
Faiths,&rdquo; etc.). This handled cross was also sacred to the
Babylonians and occurs repeatedly on their cylinders, bricks and
gems.</p>
<p class="par">In ancient Scandinavian mythology the great warrior god
Thor was always closely associated with a cruciform hammer, this being
the instrument with which he killed the great Mitgard serpent, with
which he destroyed the giants, and performed other acts of heroism.
Cruciform hammers, with a hole at the intersection of the arms for the
insertion of the haft, have been discovered in Denmark, and were used
in consecrating victims at Thor&rsquo;s altars. The cross, or hammer,
of Thor is still used in Iceland as a magical sign in connection
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>with wind and rain, just as the corresponding sign
of the cross is now used among the German peasantry to dispel a
thunderstorm; both being expressions of the same idea that the cross is
sacred to the god of thunder. As Christians blessed the full goblet
with the sign of the cross, so the ancient Vikings made the sign of the
hammer over theirs; and the signs were identical.</p>
<p class="par">The practice of making the sign of the cross before
eating, which has, in Protestant sects, degenerated to the saying of
grace, which again has assumed the form of a prayer of thanks to God
for bestowing the sustenance, was originally merely a method of
prevention against demonical possession. It was thought that demons
abounded everywhere and that one was very likely to imbibe one of these
spirits unless he took the precaution of making the sign of the cross,
which they could not endure and from which they fled. This belief in
the efficacy of a talisman, universal among all peoples from the most
barbarous to so-called civilized communities, was not only countenanced
but encouraged by Christianity, and even today we find orthodox
Christians who&mdash;although they cannot be called educated in the
highest sense, yet are not to be classed as illiterate&mdash;who are
still practicing it. Every good Catholic wears a scapular, and many a
one carries a little image of some saint to ward off disaster. The sign
of the cross is still used in time of danger and is considered a weapon
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>miraculous power. Sword hilts are still
constructed in the form of the cross to give fortune in battle, and the
masts of ships with yards were once considered the symbol of the
cross.</p>
<p class="par">The burial of the dead about churches is another modern
form of the ancient superstition that within the shadow of the cross
demons dare not disturb the body, which was necessary for resurrection
and immortality. This idea is a descendant of the ancient savage notion
that bodies in the vicinity of the idol were protected. Even in our
modern Protestant cemeteries we constantly find crosses erected over
the graves in the same superstitious manner, although in most cases it
has become merely a surviving custom, the origin of which the
performers do not know.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Accompanying the worship of the cross, we find
among orthodox Christians the adoration of the three nails of the
passion which are nothing more than a union of the two Egyptian forms
of architecture&mdash;the obelisk, expressing the male idea, and the
inverted pyramid, expressing the female.</p>
<p class="par">Two of these nails are supposed to have been found in
the time of Constantine, who adorned his helmet and horse&rsquo;s
bridle with them. Rome, Milan and Treves each boast of possessing one
of them, while still another may be seen at the church of the Holy
Cross of Jerusalem, where it is annually <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>exposed to the veneration
of the people. In 1353 Pope Innocent VI. appointed a festival for these
holy nails. Despite these facts, a legend arose in the latter part of
the sixteenth century that these three nails were fashioned into an
iron ring three-eighths of an inch broad and three-tenths thick and
presented by the Empress Helena to Constantine to protect him in
battle, and that this ring was later used to support the golden plates
of the celebrated Iron Crown of Lombardy.</p>
<p class="par">In reference to the practice of relic worship in the
Christian church, it is interesting to note that numerous objects of
worship seem endowed with remarkable powers of multiplication. The
Church of Coulombs, Diocese of <span class="corr" id="xd21e605" title=
"Source: Ch&acirc;tres">Ch&acirc;rtres</span>; the Cathedral of Pry,
the Collegiate Church of Antwerp, the Abbey of Our Savior at Charroux,
and the Church of St. John Lateran at Rome, all boast themselves the
sole possessors of the only authentic &ldquo;holy prepuce,&rdquo; which
was circumcised from Jesus on the eighth day after his birth (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%202:21">Luke ii,
21</a>), and preserved by the midwife in oil of spikenard, which was
later poured upon his head and feet by Mary Magdalene (Infancy ii,
1&ndash;4).</p>
<p class="par">Likewise, there are numerous &ldquo;holy shrouds.&rdquo;
That at Besancon, which was brought from Palestine by crusaders about
the beginning of the twelfth century, won fame by delivering the city
from a destructive plague in 1544, while that at Turin had a festival
instituted for it by Pope <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href=
"#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>Julius II. in 1506. Other authentic
shrouds may be found at the Church of St. Cornelius at Compeigne, in
Rome, Milan, Lisbon, and Aix la Chapelle.</p>
<p class="par">Another much multiplied relic is the Virgin&rsquo;s
ring, supposed to have been the marriage ring used at the nuptials of
Joseph and Mary. This sacred souvenir was discovered in 996 by a
jeweler of Jerusalem and was readily recognized by its remarkable
powers of healing and self-multiplication. Many European churches claim
to possess this ring and profess to expose it to the devout for
veneration, but, undoubtedly, the most celebrated is that held by the
Cathedral of Perouse.</p>

<p class="par">Relic worship and belief in the miraculous powers
residing in the bones of departed saints, which continues, despite the
more general education of the laity, is by no means of Christian
origin. In ancient Greece the bones of heroes were superstitiously
regarded and those of Hector of Troy were sacredly preserved at Thebes;
the tools used in the construction of the Trojan horse were kept at
Metapontum; the sceptre of Pelops was held at Ch&aelig;roneia; the
spear of Achilles at Phaselis; and the sword of Memnon at Nicomedia.
Miraculous statues of Minerva that brandished spears, abounded, and

existed.</p>

which as Prince Siddhatto he laid aside on entering the priesthood, has
been miraculously preserved, and is still shown.</p>
<p class="par">Jerome, in defending the worship of relics which had
been attacked by Vigilantus of Barcelona, did not deny that it was
adopted from paganism, but commended it and explained that as this
reverence had been previously &ldquo;only given to idols, and was then
to be detested, was now given to martyrs, and therefore to be
received.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="main">IV.&mdash;<span class="sc">Trial and Execution
Myths</span>.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">That Jesus should have been executed, either as an
historical fact or as a mythological theory, is not remarkable; and
even when considered in the light of his being one of the godhead,
there is nothing new in the relation of his death. The idea of a dying
god is very old. The grave of Zeus was shown at Crete, and the body of
Dionyseus was buried at Delphi. Osiris and Buddha both died, and
numerous deities were crucified. Krishna, the Indian god, suffered such
execution, as did also the Mexican savior Quetzalcoatl. Representations
of Krishna abound wherein he is depicted as nailed to a cross and
having a round hole in his side. Prometheus was nailed by hands and
feet to Mount Caucasus, with arms extended in the form of a cross.</p>
<p class="par">So immeasurably voluminous have been the writings of the
orthodox upon the trial, execution, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>resurrection of Jesus
that it seems advisable to consider these matters, from a rational
point of view, upon the hypothesis that such a man really lived and
suffered experiences similar to those narrated in the Gospels. With
that premise the following views are offered:</p>
<p class="par">The attitude of Jesus before Pilate shows him to have
been a willing martyr, yea, desirous of martyrdom. In all probability
his fanatical mind believed that when the supreme moment should come,
when his execution should take place, and when his death seemed
instantly imminent, some great natural phenomenon would occur to save
him. He undoubtedly believed that he would not die, but that God would
miraculously interpose to rescue him and that at that time he would not
only be saved, but that the kingdom of heaven would be established
under his control. That this was his belief seems to be shown by his
cry of disappointment when he realized that nothing supernatural was to
prevent his death. When that moment of realization came, his surprise
was evident and, unlike many of his courageous followers who died in
calmness and bravery, he cried aloud in mental and physical anguish,
&ldquo;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&rdquo; (<a class=

34</a>.)</p>
<p class="par">His indifferent bearing before Pilate showed this faith
in his redemption, for when the Roman procurator courteously asked him
if he were the king <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30"
name="pb30">30</a>]</span>of the Jews, he replied ambiguously, as had
always been his practice, &ldquo;Thou sayest it&rdquo; (<a class=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2018:37">John xviii,
37</a>; Nicodemus iii, 10). But such ambiguity, which had served very
well among the lower classes who had flocked to hear and question him,
was of no avail before the matter-of-fact Roman, who, as an imperial
officer, desired straightforward answers, and was little impressed by
Jesus&rsquo; silence, except that he was rightfully astonished that
when given the chance the prisoner should not have availed himself of
it to explain his position. Therefore, seeing Jesus had no will to
answer his questions except in an exasperating manner, after he had
shown a willingness to save him, Pilate delivered Jesus over to the
Jews according to the custom of the Romans in regard to the theological
disputes of a subject people&mdash;but not until he had requested them
to spare the preacher. Had Jesus given the Roman a frank explanation of
his position as an itinerant preacher, Pilate would probably have saved
him, but the chimerical idea of the interposition of God by a miracle,
which would glorify him above all else that could occur, led Jesus to
make a willing sacrifice of himself and throw away the opportunity
offered him by Pilate.</p>
<p class="par">There is nothing noble nor grand in this impudent
conduct toward the Roman officer, but there is a good deal of justice
and consideration in the conduct of Pilate. There is nothing noble in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>Jesus&rsquo; willingness to die nor in his
courting death at this trial, for it was entirely unnecessary and was
desired on his part only because he expected a miraculous salvation.
According to his belief, he was to be the gainer, and he staked his
life for a heavenly glory and lost, although he was probably keen
enough to see that in any case his death would increase his fame, for
the execution of a fanatic always lends a little glory to a cause, no
matter how base, as witness the desire of anarchists for martyrdom and
the attitude with which they view those who die for their horrible
ideas.</p>
<p class="par">The only question with the Roman was as to whether Jesus
had proclaimed himself the king of the Jews, and as he declined to
answer this question, Pilate could do nothing to save him. The blind
hatred of orthodox Christianity toward Pilate is absurd. Aside from the
argument above, there is another reason why his memory should be
leniently treated. According to the Christian dogma, Jesus was the son
of God, and it was only by his sacrifice, by his actual death, that he
could save man. By dying he took the sins of mankind upon himself, and
thus became the Savior. As the eternal Son, knowing all things, as a
part of the godhead, he knew his death must occur&mdash;that was his
mission on earth. Therefore, as instruments in the accomplishment of
this grand plan, by which mankind was saved, and Jesus became the
Savior, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>Caiaphas and Pontius Pilate should be regarded as
divine agents worthy of glory and praise. Any other conclusion is
entirely illogical. But then, who will look for logic in the dogmas of
Christianity? When one makes a logical investigation of this faith, he
abandons its unreasonable teachings, which cannot be accepted by a
logical mind. The person who allows his reason to govern his belief
cannot in any way accept the teachings of the absurd and ridiculous
Christian cult.</p>
<p class="par">While suffering his execution, Jesus, according to the
Gospel writers, lost both his moral and physical courage, and cried
aloud in agony, &ldquo;Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?&rdquo; In view of
this fact, it seems impossible for reasonable creatures to accept the
Christian dogmas of the atonement and the trinity, for, if Jesus were
one of the godhead and had left his heavenly abode to descend to earth
for the especial purpose of saving mankind by shedding his blood for
them, he must necessarily have been aware of what was in store for him
and have known all the details attendant upon his execution.</p>
<p class="par">Looking at this fable rationally, Jesus was inferior in
courage to many of his followers. When we recall the innumerable
martyrs who went to meet death with smiling lips, in perfect
confidence, the wailing savior, with his doubting cry to God, presents
anything but an impressive figure. Surely, to burn at the stake, to lie
under the axe, to endure <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href=
"#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>the awful tortures of the
Inquisition, were fully as agonizing as a crucifixion; and yet
men&mdash;and delicate women&mdash;who have never pretended to
divinity, have borne these things silently.</p>
<p class="par">To be sure, the whole story of the Christ is largely
legendary and very uncertain, but, according to the gospels of Matthew
and Mark, Jesus was weak in his convictions, afraid to die for his own
teachings, and on the whole, his conduct at the supreme moment reminds
one of the weak French peasants of revolutionary times rather than the
brave nobility. His peasant blood rose to the surface and in his fear
he cried, &ldquo;Why hast thou forsaken me?&rdquo; although but a few
moments before he had assured one of the malefactors who suffered
beside him that on this day he should be in paradise (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2023:43">Luke xxiii,
43</a>).</p>
<p class="par">Everything considered, it is not strange that the Jews
would not accept Jesus as the awaited messiah who should free them from
the yoke of Rome. They desired a strong and powerful leader, not a
socialistic wandering teacher, and the prophecies promised a ruler
surpassing the wisdom and power of the gorgeous Solomon. There is not
one prophetic passage in the Old Testament that can properly be applied
to Jesus, although many have been distorted for such purpose. The Jews
looked upon him as an impostor and a revolutionist who not only
pretended to be what he was not, but who <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>disregarded their ancient
laws and preached a doctrine contrary to that held by their rabbis.</p>
<p class="par">It was not until long after his death that he was
regarded as a prophet, and it was not until every proof of his very
existence had vanished that divine honors were paid him. To the Jews he
was a vagrant revolutionist worthy of death, and the Jews knew him
personally; to a large majority of twentieth century Christians, he is
a god, and they know absolutely nothing about him, save a collection of
puerile myths which tax their credulity as children, but which as
adults they accept.</p>
<p class="par">However, regarding the execution of Jesus, there is
always the legitimate doubt that it ever occurred. Aside from the fact
that the usual mode of death for criminals was by hanging, there is
much internal evidence in the gospels themselves which points to the
conclusion that the whole story of the execution and resurrection is
mythical and was composed from various Hebrew and pagan legends. The
dying cry was copied verbatim from <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

passover, the Jews had conformed to this practice of not breaking the
bones of the animals eaten. But the biographers saw Jesus as the
paschal lamb, and associated him with the meat of the passover. The
tendency to regard his body as the solid of the Eucharist has likewise
aided in this construction of the passages in Exodus and Numbers into a
prophecy. In David&rsquo;s apostrophe to the righteous he says that
though their afflictions are many, &ldquo;the Lord delivereth him out

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">VI.&mdash;<span class="sc">The
Resurrection.</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Regarding the resurrection, it is interesting to
note that, whereas most crucified men lived a number of hours and even
a day in this torture, the wounds in the hands not being mortal and the
position only affecting the circulation, causing death by exhaustion or
starvation, Jesus lived only three hours. Therefore, it may have been
that he was not actually dead, but merely in a state of coma, or
perhaps a cataleptic condition. The custom he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>had of
using his subjective mind in telepathic cures, as told in the gospels,
seems to point to this conclusion, that, being strongly subjective, his
condition here was cataleptic. Many cases are known of men having been
restored after crucifixion, and, as the embalming given Jesus in the
Jewish custom consisted in nothing more than a wrapping in a shroud
with myrrh and aloes, there is nothing to oppose this hypothesis. After
resting for a while in the tomb, he may have revived and gone out and
been seen by others, after which he wandered away again to die in
solitude from exhaustion and lack of food.</p>
<p class="par">It is more probable, however, that this legend was
copied from those of other religious heroes, who likewise rose from the
dead, as there seems to be much variance between the different versions
of the visit of Mary Magdalene to the sepulchre and her meeting with
Christ. Matthew says (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2028:1">xxviii, 1</a>)
that Mary Magdalene and the other Mary visited the sepulchre (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2028:3">3</a>), where
they saw a male angel descend from heaven during an earthquake and roll
back the stone from the door and sit upon it (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2028:7">7</a>). And he
told them to &ldquo;go quickly, and tell his disciples&rdquo; that he
had risen, which they did. But as they were going (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2028:9">9</a>)
&ldquo;Jesus met them ... and they came ... and worshiped him.&rdquo;
Mark tells a similar story with some variations as to the angel, but he
relates that Jesus appeared first to Mary Magdalene &ldquo;early the
first day of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>week&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2016:9">xvi, 9</a>),
and not on her visit with Mary, the mother of James, and Salome at the
tomb. According to Luke, the women went to the tomb, where they were
informed by (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2024:4">xxiv, 4</a>)
&ldquo;two men in shining garments&rdquo; that Jesus had risen, and
they left and told the apostles. No mention is made here of the
encounter of Mary Magdalene. John, however, gives a more elaborate
version. He narrates (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2020">xx</a>) that
Mary, going early and alone to the tomb, which she found entirely
empty, ran and informed Peter, who verified her story and departed.
After she was left alone she looked into the sepulchre again, where she
beheld two angels, and on turning away saw Jesus standing by her.</p>
<p class="par">Setting aside the idea of a mythical plagiarism in these
tales, and also the cataleptic theory already mentioned, and
considering them from yet another point of view, we can still find a
rational explanation. The meeting of Jesus with Mary may have been the
hallucination of a hysterical woman. According to <a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2016:9">Mark xvi,
9</a>, and <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%208:2">Luke viii,
2</a>, Jesus had cast seven devils out of her, which is surely
sufficient proof that she was of neurotic temperament and had been
subject to delusions and hysteria. Undoubtedly after the shock of
witnessing the crucifixion and death of her master, for three gospels
agree in stating that she was present (<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2027:56">Matt. xxvii,

"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2019:25">John xix,
25</a>), this fond woman&rsquo;s mind, which seemed more normal in his
presence, again gave way and she returned to her hysterical
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>condition. On visiting the tomb, she found it
empty because &ldquo;his disciples came by night and stole him
away,&rdquo; that they might declare he had risen from the dead,
&ldquo;as is commonly reported among the Jews until this day&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2028:11-15">Matt.
xxviii, 11&ndash;15</a>). As she was leaving, she heard his voice (a
common delusion of hysterical subjects) and saw his form (another
hallucination), but when she went to touch him, she could not do so.
The relation has all the marks of simple neurosis, and yet many modern
Christians base their whole faith upon the words of Paul in <a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015:14">1

preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.&rdquo;</p>

"A MESSIAH WHO &ldquo;IS RISEN.&rdquo;" width="467" height="622">
<p class="figureHead">A MESSIAH WHO &ldquo;IS RISEN.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par first">The drawing of this ancient deity, the Lord Hesus,
is from a monument in the Cluny Museum, Paris. He was the messiah of
the Gauls in Europe and Asia, and his worship has been traced to 2112
B. C. He is fabled to have suffered crucifixion, arisen from the dead,
and ascended into heaven.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">As noted in various parts of this work, unless
Christians believe in the possibility of miracles, the power of a
personal devil, and the physical resurrection of the body, there is no
foundation for their faith, and it is a mockery.</p>
<p class="par">Not satisfied with having executed their god according
to the most approved methods of antiquity, Christians felt the
necessity of the presence of some remarkable natural phenomena at the
time of his death, for among all ancient peoples it was customary to
attribute some remarkable natural convulsions to the death of a great
man. When Prometheus was crucified on Mount Caucasus &ldquo;the earth
quaked, thunder roared, lightning flashed, wild winds rent the air and
boisterous billows rose.&rdquo; On the death of Romulus, there was
&ldquo;darkness over <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41"
name="pb41">41</a>]</span>the face of the earth for six hours,&rdquo;
and when Quetzalcoatl died the sun became black! Even in historical
times, we find narrations of similar phenomena accompanying the deaths
of royalty; and we read in many authenticated histories of the
frightful thunderstorms that were coincident with the deaths of
Isabella of Castile, Charles the Fifth, Napoleon the Great, and Oliver
Cromwell.</p>
<p class="par">Therefore, it is not surprising to find mention of such
occurrences at the time of the execution of the Christian god, although
we are not prepared for such astonishing and unprecedented phenomena as
related by the ever exaggerating author of the &ldquo;Gospel according
to St. Matthew,&rdquo; who states very seriously that &ldquo;the vail
of the temple was rent in twain from top to bottom; and the earth did
quake, and the rocks rent; and the graves were opened; and many bodies
of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after his
resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto
many.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But the execution, while it completes the mortal life of
the incarnate Christian deity, by no means finishes the legend. Like
the gods of antiquity, the Christ must also descend into hell and
perform wonders similar to those of the ancient heroes. All the saviors
of mankind had done so&mdash;Zoroaster, the Persian; Osiris, the
Egyptian; Baldur, the Scandinavian; <span class="corr" id="xd21e863"
title="Source: Quetzacoatl">Quetzalcoatl</span>, the Mexican; and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>Krishna, the Hindu; while Ishtar voluntarily
descended into the Assyrian inferno.</p>
<p class="par">Having descended into hell, resurrection was necessary,
for it was unreasonable that the savior of mankind, the son of the
supreme god, should remain perpetually in the place of punishment; and,
as his life on earth was over, he could no longer abide there, and so
the only plausible sequence was an ascension to heaven. Krishna, the
crucified Hindu savior, rose from the dead and ascended bodily into the
celestial regions, as did Rama, another avatar of Vishnu. Buddha also
ascended bodily into heaven when his mission on earth was fulfilled,
and marks on the rocks of a high mountain are shown as the last
impressions of his footsteps on earth. Zoroaster and &AElig;sculapius
also had similar experiences, as did Elijah and Adonis. Osiris rose
from the dead and bore the title of &ldquo;The Resurrected One,&rdquo;
his ascension being celebrated in Egypt at the vernal equinox, as is
the Christ&rsquo;s and as was Adonis&rsquo;. Other saviors who rose
from the dead were Dionysius, Herakles, Memnon, Baldur and
Quetzalcoatl.</p>
<p class="par">Modern Catholics are still taught the fables of the
bodily ascension of Jesus, Mary the Virgin, and Mary the Magdalene and
many other holy persons, as actual miraculous truths, not to be
questioned nor denied.</p>
<p class="par">Very good, but how can educated Catholics of today
reconcile such <i>truths</i> with their actual scientific <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>knowledge? They know that the earth is spherical,
that the stars and planets are members of solar systems, that outside
the terrestrial atmosphere is nothing but vast space. There is no such
place as a heaven anywhere in these celestial regions, and the zenith
of any geographical situation changes every moment. Clouds are mere
masses of vapor, not furniture for the repose of the glorified dead.
Then whither did these adored beings ascend? Certainly, God in his love
for them never flung them far into space to whirl about for
eternity.</p>
<p class="par">These Catholics also know the law of gravitation, which
would not allow of such a method of transportation. But why ask these
questions? No religious person is capable of thinking sensibly on the
teachings of his faith, no matter how ridiculous. He accepts, as an
adult, what he questions as a child.</p>
<p class="par">While the idea of bodily ascension of the Christ was
probably copied into his biography from that of Enoch (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%205:24">Gen.
v</a><a id="xd21e886" name="xd21e886"></a>, 24) and Elijah (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kgs%202:11">2 Kings
ii, 11</a>), such stories form a large part of the annals of classical
mythology, almost every hero of antiquity having been translated to the
heavens when his earthly life was spent. The custom of converting the
tombs of prominent Christians into shrines likewise aided this belief,
as, it being impossible to discover the burial places of the most
conspicuous, the idea arose that they had been physically removed to
heaven. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The principal weakness of all the great theological
systems now in practice is that they are terrestrial in their
conception of God and man. Their foundations were laid at a period when
mankind knew little, and cared less, about the planets; at a period
when it was presumed that the sun, moon, and stars were either
beneficent deities or natural objects placed in the firmament to light
the world and please the eye of man by their beauty. Therefore God, as
recognized in these systems, takes heed of naught else than this
particular world. He totally ignores the other innumerable spheres of
matter floating in space, many of which may support life. All his
interests center on this infinitesimal portion of his creation. It is
with the doings of the inhabitants of <i>this</i> planet that he is
engaged. For this earth alone he creates man, animals and vegetables;
to <i>this</i> alone, he sends his only son, or Savior; and it is here,
in the purified state, that the souls of men shall eternally dwell
after the great judgment.</p>
<p class="par">Since science has proved that our solar system is but
one of the many, and that in this system the earth is not the largest
nor most important body, should not such absurd theological ideas be
abandoned and a grander <span class="corr" id="xd21e903" title=
"Source: annd">and</span> vaster conception of the Deity be
inaugurated? Should not organized theology turn to nobler thoughts and
say with Paul, &ldquo;When I was a child ... I thought as a child;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>but when I became a man, I put away childish
things&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2013:11">1 Cor.
xiii, 11</a>)?</p>
<p class="par">All such doctrines as predestination, which are based
upon the sin of Adam, are now anachronistic. The acceptance of the
theory of evolution, which entirely destroys the reality of the
mythical Adam, sweeps away his biography and leaves no foundation for
such dogmas. If the Christian church desires to remain, she must cast
aside these worthless doctrines, founded upon false hypotheses, when
the minds of men were in darkness regarding the origin of species, and
when they saw in these the only solution of their problem.</p>
<p class="par">Having accomplished his ascension and entered on his
eternal kingdom, one of the Christ&rsquo;s attributes is that of
judging the dead. This idea undoubtedly came from the Alexandrian
school of theology, where so many of the Christian theories were
promulgated, for one of the best-known attributes of Osiris was that of
the judge, and he was generally represented as seated on his throne of
judgment, bearing a staff (the crozier of the modern bishop) and
holding the crux ansata. Buddha is also supposed to be the judge of the
dead.</p>
<p class="par">In connection with the idea of the Christ as the divine
judge of men, certain sects of Christians have advocated that of his
return to earth at some future period, which will terminate all
terrestrial life as it is known to-day, basing this belief upon
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>Jesus&rsquo; own proclamation of his second
advent, although in his prophecy he declared the coming of the kingdom
of heaven to be soon after his death. He even told his disciples that

advent was copied from the Persian theology, it being one of the tenets
of the Zoroastrian religion that in the end Ormuzd, God of Light,
should conquer Ahriman, God of Darkness, and that he should then summon
the good from their graves, remove all <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par">But such ideas are not unique to Christians and
Persians. The Hindus believe that Vishnu will have another avatar; the
Siamese live in constant expectation of the second coming of Codom; the
Buddhists are looking forward to the return of Buddha; the Jews are
awaiting the messiah; and the disciples of Quetzalcoatl expected that
deity&rsquo;s second advent&mdash;and most unfortunately thought their
dream realized on the arrival of the Spaniards, who took advantage of
their consequent submissiveness to exterminate them.</p>

<p class="par first">It is customary among orthodox Christians to
assert that the godhead of their Christ was fully proven by the many
miracles attributed to him in the New Testament. But one must not
forget that the performance of miracles is one of the most common
attributes of founders of new sects, and one which all religious
charlatans claim. Krishna lulled tempests, cured lepers, and restored
the dead; Buddha, Zoroaster (who walked on water on his way to Mount
Iran to receive the law), Horus, &AElig;sculapius, and innumerable
others did likewise. Mohammed, not content with miracles of the
omnipotent physician type, juggled the moon through his sleeve. Even
to-day faith in miracles <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href=
"#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>is not dead, and miracle-working
attributes have been claimed for Mrs. Eddy, founder of Christian
Science, Dowie, founder of Zion City, and Sandford, leader of the Holy
Ghost and Us.</p>
<p class="par">There can be no doubt in the mind of a student of
comparative theology that Moncure D. Conway was correct when he stated
in his essay on Christianity that &ldquo;among all the miracles of the
New Testament not one is original. Bacchus changed water into wine....
Moses and Elias also fasted forty days.... Pythagoras had power to
still waves and tempests at sea. Elijah made the widow&rsquo;s meal and
oil increase; Elisha fed a hundred men with twenty loaves.... As for
opening blind eyes, healing diseases, walking on water, casting out
demons, raising the dead, resurrection, ascension, all these have been
common myths&mdash;logic currency of every race.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One of the best attested miracles of all profane
history is that which Tacitus reports of Vespasian, who cured a blind
man in Alexandria by means of his spittle, and a lame man by the mere
touch of his foot, in obedience to a vision of the god Serapis,&rdquo;
says Hume in his &ldquo;Essay on Miracles,&rdquo; and we might here
mention the numerous attested cures resulting from the laying on of
royal hands by divinely appointed sovereigns.</p>
<p class="par">The rulers of France, Aragon, and England touched for
scrofula, this practice being continued by the latter from the period
of its origin with Edward <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href=
"#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>the Confessor until the accession of
William the Third, whose good sense put an end to it. James the Second,
the last practitioner of this art, had so great a belief in his
curative powers that he set aside certain days on which he touched the
afflicted from his throne at Whitehall, while the sufferers came in
throngs to kneel at his feet. The princes of the house of Austria
likewise held divine power and were supposed to be capable of casting
out devils and curing stammering by the touch of their aristocratic
fingers.</p>
<p class="par">Numerous cases are narrated in which Jesus, by simply
touching the person of the afflicted, effected instantaneous cures.

<p class="par">Among all primitive peoples, the principal cause of
disease was supposed to lie in the displeasure of some deity toward the
afflicted person, who was punished by this deity for some offense or
neglect (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2038:3">Psalms
xxxviii, 3</a>). One of the favorite methods of the gods in afflicting
was sending evil and tormenting spirits into the body of the victim.
After more was learned of disease, this theory gradually diminished in
strength as regarded some troubles, but for centuries it was the
universal theory that mental derangements and nervous afflictions were
solely due to demoniacal possession, and all priests and medicine-men
resorted to various exorcisms, from the primitive banging of gongs and
tooting of trumpets to scare away the spirit, to the prayers and
sprinkling of holy water of the medi&aelig;val church to rid the
patient of the unwelcome inhabitant of his body.</p>
<p class="par">That Jesus believed in this demoniacal possession is
undoubted, and he effected his cures by ordering or calling out the
devil from the body of the possessed. For example, there is a story of
Jesus driving devils into an innocent herd of swine (<a class=

<p class="par">In all probability, these medical miracles of Jesus were
copied from older legends by his biographers. But, even if they
actually occurred, they were not miracles at all, for a miracle must
be, in the very meaning of the word, performed by the suspension of a
natural law, and from all gospel accounts the mental therapeutics of
the Christ were performed, if at all, in perfect accordance with
well-established psychological laws. They had been performed years
before his birth, and they have continued to be performed years after
his death, even to the present time. Through the force of faith, the
patients were placed in passivity (hypnosis) and treated by suggestions
being impressed upon their subjective minds, when present; at a
distance, they were cured by the telepathic suggestions conveyed from
the healer to their subjective mentalities. There is no miracle here;
it is merely a demonstration of telepathic and hypnotic phenomena,
governed by psychic laws, and does not place the Christ on a higher
intellectual plane than modern hypnotists and mental healers, who
consciously and knowingly work within the dispensation of these laws.
They are anything but proofs of the godhead of Jesus.</p>
<p class="par">It would seem that the Pharisees had some such idea in
mind when they demanded an astronomical miracle and requested &ldquo;a
sign from heaven.&rdquo; But, unable to comply, he evaded this
performance by calling them hypocrites and &ldquo;an evil and
adulterous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=

<p class="par">One of the commonest miracles ascribed to religious
leaders of all sects and times, and one which never fails to convince
witnesses and hearers of the authenticity of such a leader&rsquo;s
claims, is that of restoring the dead to life. Such miracles have been
so well attested that there seems little reason to suppose them
entirely fictitious.</p>
<p class="par">Everyone has heard of cases of catalepsy, and medical
history teems with cases of &ldquo;suspended animation&rdquo;; in fact,
the only actual proof of death is the entire decomposition of the vital
organs; therefore, the cruelty and crime of embalming corpses before
such a condition is apparent. Some undertakers actually insist upon
embalming before such conditions, because the dead can then be made to
&ldquo;present a better appearance&rdquo;!</p>
<p class="par">There are numerous well-proven cases of people lying for
days in cataleptic conditions, even with slight signs of decomposition
due to restricted circulation, and then returning to renewed lives and
perfectly healthy states. All Eastern travelers are familiar with the
practices of Hindu fakirs who allow themselves to be buried alive for
weeks, and are &ldquo;resurrected&rdquo; without having suffered.
Therefore, it does not seem improbable that some such acts on the parts
of various religious leaders may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53"
href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>have occurred which have excited
wonder with the ignorant, and interest among the educated. The early
Christians proclaimed many such wonderful works, albeit when challenged
by a wealthy pagan to produce even one such case, in payment for which
he would become a convert, a failure was the result.</p>
<p class="par">Orthodox Christians proclaim that Jesus raised from
death Jairus&rsquo; daughter, in entire forgetfulness of the actual
words accredited to their leader, which were, &ldquo;The maid is not
dead, but sleepeth&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=

52</a>), showing his opinion that she was in a cataleptic condition.
While neither of the first three gospels says aught of the raising of
Lazarus, we find it in John, who seems to have substituted it for the
story of Jairus&rsquo; daughter, which does not appear in his gospel.
According to this hyperbolical and probably demented authority, Jesus
raised Lazarus to life after he had been dead four days (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2011:17">John xi,
17</a>), although Jesus maintained that Lazarus was <i>not</i> dead
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2011:11">John xi,
11</a>). He declared that &ldquo;this sickness is not unto death, but
for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified
there-by&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2011:4">John xi,
4</a>), or, in other words, Jesus believed that the unfortunate Lazarus
was obliged to undergo this frightful experience that his seeming
resurrection might cause gaping among the vulgar, and add to the
prestige of the miracle worker. For this reason, he purposely postponed
going to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>the dying man, whom he might have saved, that he
might later have the glory of bringing him to life! Excellent ethics!
Finally, however, when he did depart, he said positively, &ldquo;Our
friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of
sleep&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2011:11">John xi,
11</a>). Having arrived at the sepulchre, he approached it, groaning
and weeping, in a most theatrical manner, such as would appeal to a
highly strung audience, and cried in a loud voice, &ldquo;Lazarus, come
forth!&rdquo; whereupon the dead man arose and came out (<a class=

<p class="par">Now, this may have been catalepsy, and it may have been
the strong voice and will of the Christ which caused the awakening,
but, in all probability, if the affair ever occurred, it was a
preconceived dramatic incident. All the actors were partisans of the
professed messiah, and the whole story reads like a play, and
undoubtedly the words &ldquo;come forth&rdquo; were the cue for the
waiting man to appear.</p>
<p class="par">It is by such contemptible methods that religions are
established. If the tale were due to the imagination of the author of
John, it is most discreditable to him, and places his hero in a very
bad light. If it actually occurred, it shows Jesus as a vain-glorious
boaster, anxious to show his power to the vulgar, and desirous of
gaining a following by charlatanry, either by raising a hypnotized man
or by creating a cheap melodrama.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=

when he accepted the part of the messiah, and to condescend to soil his
mission by charlatanism, even to the raising of the dead in imitation

<p class="par">It is rather amusing to hear Theodore Christlieb, that
well-named, sturdy old German supporter of orthodoxy, boldly assert in
irrevocable simplicity and straightforwardness, in his &ldquo;Modern
Doubt and Christian Belief&rdquo;: &ldquo;However much in other
respects our opponents may differ, they all agree in the denial of
miracles, and unitedly storm this bulwark of the Christian faith; and
in its defense we have to combat them all at once. But whence this
unanimity? Because <i>with the truth of miracles the entire citadel of
Christianity stands or falls</i>. [The italics are his own.] For its
beginning is a miracle, its author is a miracle, its progress depends
upon miracles, and they will hereafter be its consummation. If the
principle of miracles be set aside, then all the heights of
Christianity will be leveled with one stroke, and naught will remain
but a heap of ruins. If we banish the supernatural from the Bible,
there is nothing left us but the covers&rdquo; (pages 285&ndash;6).</p>

<p class="par first">The dogma of the atonement which very naturally
resulted from the theological interpretation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>of the
crucifixion, was readily accepted by the Christian church. The idea of
averting disasters by sacrifice and thus causing one devoted victim to
bear the load of the sins of others, in payment of which his death was
acceptable, is one of the greatest antiquity, and we find sacrifices of
various kinds offered to propitiate the deities, from the simple
offerings of primitive man to the more elaborate sacrifices of a more
complicated society. Finally came the idea of human sacrifice and then
the culminating theory of the sacrifice of a divine being whose
suffering should atone for all the sins of mankind. The belief of
redemption from sin by the sufferings of a divine incarnation was
general and popular centuries before the time of Jesus. In the temple
of the moon the Albanians of the eastern Caucasus kept a number of
sacred slaves. When one exhibited more than usual symptoms of
inspiration, the high priest maintained him in the utmost luxury for a
year, after which he was anointed and led forth to be sacrificed. After
his death, the people stood upon the body as a purificationary
ceremony, it being believed that the dead man was possessed of a divine
spirit. The ancient Greeks were also familiar with the use of the human
scapegoat, and it was customary at Marsailles, one of the busiest and
most brilliant of the Greek colonies, to sacrifice an inspired man when
the city was ravaged by the plague. All are familiar with the old
Jewish practice of using the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href=
"#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>scapegoat as the vehicle for the
expiation of sins, and the whole theory of the atonement is little more
than a modernized expression of the old idea that the sins of the
community may be delegated to one agent to be sacrificed for the
purification of the rest.</p>
<p class="par">The prophecy, as it is called by John, made by Caiaphas,
the high priest, &ldquo;it is expedient for us that one man should die
for the people, and that the whole nation perish not&rdquo; (<a class=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2018:14">xviii,
14</a>), which has been seized upon by the Christians as a reference to
the vicarious atonement, is nothing more than the opinion of an ardent
orthodox Jew that if Jesus were permitted to live and preach he would
destroy the ancient faith and his converts would abandon the old
religion. The words &ldquo;it is expedient <i>for us</i>&rdquo; qualify
the whole statement. They signified that the priesthood would be
without a following were he allowed to continue. The idea of a
vicarious atonement for all the people would have been of no expediency
whatever to Caiaphas and his class. They felt that if orthodoxy fell by
Jesus&rsquo; preaching, the Romans could easily crush them, for it was
only by their union and the support of their ancient rites that they
could form any front to the imperial government; it was by these alone
that they had any political significance. Once dismembered, the Jews
would be scattered to the corners of the earth (<a class=

that it was never accepted by them.</p>
<p class="par">Some old Christian writers believed that it was to the
devil that the Christ was sacrificed. Their belief in the justice of
the Supreme would not allow them to think that he demanded the
sacrifice of an innocent for the sins of the guilty. Proclus of
Constantinople, in the age of Austin, wrote that &ldquo;the devil held
us in a state of servitude, boasting that he had bought us. It was
necessary, therefore, that all being condemned, either they should be
dragged to death, or a sufficient price be paid; and because no angel
had the wherewithal to pay it, it remained that God should die for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">While such an idea is certainly of a higher moral nature
than that which states that God sacrificed his own innocent son for
man, it has the unfortunate result of attributing to the devil greater
power than to God; for if the devil could demand and receive a part of
the god-head as ransom, then God himself was weaker than the arch
fiend. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Hislop, in his &ldquo;Two Babylons,&rdquo; commenting
upon the Chaldean doctrine that it was &ldquo;by the works and merits
of men themselves that they must be justified and accepted of
God,&rdquo; utterly condemns it, and glories in the dogma of the
atonement with great and illogical pleasure. Having reviewed the
Egyptian belief that Anubis weighed the merits and defects of departed
souls, so that Osiris, in accordance with the result, might judge and
sentence them; and the Parsee belief that the Angel of Justice sat on
the bridge of Chinevad, which connected heaven and earth, weighing
souls to decide whether or not they should enter paradise, he condemns
such theories as &ldquo;utterly demoralizing,&rdquo; and asserts that
no believer can ever have &ldquo;any solid feeling of comfort, or
assurance as to his prospects in the eternal world,&rdquo; which very
fact would seem conducive to clean lives and good deeds. Then he
continues in ecstasy to exalt the immoral Christian doctrine of
&ldquo;justification by faith alone,&rdquo; which he declares
<i>alone</i> &ldquo;can produce a life of loving, filial, hearty
obedience to the law and commands of God,&rdquo; and by which man may
reach salvation &ldquo;absolutely irrespective of human merits, simply
and solely through the righteousness of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This is one of the most absurd and immoral doctrines of
all the absurd and immoral doctrines of Christianity, and one which
leads to all varieties of crime and misery. A man who believes that
simple faith <i>alone</i> is a perfect and acceptable passport
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>to eternal bliss will take no pains to lead either
a decent or useful life. He is at liberty to commit all the crimes
known to his nature; he may murder, steal, rape, and lie with impunity,
for his faith in Christ will save him from his well-deserved
punishment; while a man of high ethical standards and immaculate moral
principles, who spends his whole life in self-sacrifice for the
progress of humanity is doomed to damnation, unless he believe! What a
horrible doctrine! What a blasphemous conception of the justice of
God!</p>
<p class="par">Every student of comparative theology knows that such
views of atonement were centuries old at the date of the supposed birth
of the Christ, and that all sorts of sacrifices were made at the altars
of different gods with the same idea of atonement; but, aside from
this, is there not something cowardly and mean in trying to shirk the
responsibilities of one&rsquo;s actions upon either an animal, a man,
or a god? Is it not contemptible to suppose that the death and
suffering of another will allow one to go unpunished, or that such
suffering is a license for humanity to sin? All that is ridiculous,
blasphemous, and illogical appears in this stupid dogma.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">IX.&mdash;<span class="sc">The
Trinity&mdash;Mariolatry</span>.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The dogma of the trinity, which was introduced,
strongly advocated, and finally successfully lobbied through the famous
Council of Nica&aelig; in 315, by that astute theological politician
Athanasius, Bishop <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61"
name="pb61">61</a>]</span>of Alexandria, split the Christian church in
twain and threw Europe into turmoil and bloodshed.</p>
<p class="par">Athanasius was the leader of the Alexandrian school of
Christian theology which drew its inspirations and ideas
largely&mdash;one might almost say, exclusively&mdash;from ancient
Egyptian sources. The Egyptians were an essentially religious people
whose deistic ideas were surrounded by ceremony, priestcraft, and
mysticism, all of which made such a deep impression upon the pliant
minds of the Alexandrian Christians that they molded their new faith in
the form of their old.</p>
<p class="par">The Egyptians highly revered the number three, which
they generally represented under the form of a triangle. To the
Egyptians nothing could be perfect or complete unless it was of three
component parts. Therefore, their gods were generally grouped in sets
of three, many cities having their own especial trinities. Horus was
divided into three persons, and Osiris, Isis and Horus were worshiped
under the sign of the triangle.</p>
<p class="par">But Egypt was not alone in her trinitarian ideas. The
theory of sex worship had a strong hold on all the peoples of
antiquity, and it is not surprising to find similar religious
expressions in India. One of the most prominent features of Indian
theology is the doctrine of the divine triad governing all things. This
triad is called the Tri-murti and consists of Brahma, the creator,
Vishnu, the preserver, and Siva, the destroyer. It is an inseparable
unity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>though three in form. The inhabitants of China and
Japan, most of whom are Buddhists, worship God in the form of a
trinity. The Persians have a similar triad composed of Ormuzd, the
creator, Mithras, the son, and Ahriman, the destroyer. The ancient
Scandinavians likewise worshiped a triple deity who was yet one god,
and consisted of Odin, Thor, and Frey.</p>
<p class="par">One of the many weak points in the doctrine of the
trinity, and one that must be noticeable even to Christians, is that,
according to the New Testament, the apostles themselves never seem to
have recognized the divinity of Jesus, but always treated him as a
human Jew like themselves. This attitude of the early Christian
disciples is noted by Priestley, who remarks in his &ldquo;Corruptions
of Christianity&rdquo; (page 136): &ldquo;It can never be thought that
Peter and the others would have made so free with our Lord, as they
sometimes did, if they had considered him as their <i>maker</i>, and
the being who supported the whole universe; and therefore must have
been present in every part of creation, giving his attention to
everything, and exerting his power upon everything, at the same time
that he was familiarly conversing with them. Moreover, the history of
the <i>temptation</i> must be altogether improbable in such a
supposition. For what could be the offer of the kingdoms of this world
to him who made the world, and was already in possession of it?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Numerous texts which tend to affirm the humanity of
Jesus have been stumbling blocks in the paths of the trinitarians, and
they have taken great pains to explain away these embarrassing texts,
even at the cost of much ingenuity and absurdity. Paul, the real
founder of the faith, in his first epistle to Timothy, says: &ldquo;For
there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the <i>man</i>
Christ Jesus&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Tm%202:5">1 Tim. ii,
5</a>); and again in his first epistle to John he remarks: &ldquo;No
man hath seen God&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Jn%204:12">1 John iv,
12</a>). Such phrases as &ldquo;Why callest thou me good? There is none
good but one, that is God&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2019:17">Matt. xix,
17</a>), and &ldquo;But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told
you the truth, which I have heard of God&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%208:40">John viii,
40</a>), do not appear to be fitting remarks for the second person of
the trinity. Again, the words, &ldquo;My Father is greater than
I&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2014:28">John xiv,
28</a>), were likewise difficult of explanation by those who held that
every member of the trinity is coequal, but Austin got around this by
declaring that &ldquo;Christ having emptied himself of his former
glory, and being in form of a servant, was then less, not only than his
Father, but even than himself&rdquo;!</p>
<p class="par">The same writer asserts that the words, &ldquo;that the
Son knew not the time of the day of judgment, but only the
Father&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2013:32">Mark xiii,
32</a>), means that while Jesus did know something of the trinity, he
would not make it known to others&mdash;thus making a downright liar of
his God. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The whole of trinitarianism is epitomized in the phrase
of Peter Lombard, who, having made the impossible arithmetical
assertion that no one person of the trinity is less than the other two,
says: &ldquo;He that can receive this, let him receive it; but he that
cannot, let him, however, believe it; and let him pray that what he
believes he may understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Jesus having been ordained one of the godhead, the only
begotten son of the most high god, the worship of his mother naturally
followed; for who could reasonably refuse to bend the knee to the one
virgin of all humanity, considered worthy of the honor of bearing the
incarnate deity? It was all the easier for the Christian church to
adopt this practice, that it had been one of the principal features of
the ancient theologies. All nations have worshiped a pure, chaste queen
of heaven, a personification of that beautiful celestial body that
smiles so benignly down on earth every month. In every land the moon
was worshiped as a mother goddess, pure, beautiful, and loving; for
there is not the slightest doubt that the virgin queen of heaven, so
commonly worshiped by all nations, was merely a personification of the
moon.</p>
<p class="par">Isis, mother of the Egyptian savior Horus, was worshiped
as a virgin and was styled &ldquo;Our Lady,&rdquo; &ldquo;Queen of
Heaven,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mother of God,&rdquo; &ldquo;Intercessor,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Immaculate Virgin.&rdquo; She was commonly represented with
the divine infant seated on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href=
"#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>her lap, or standing on a crescent
moon, and having a glory of twelve stars about her head.</p>
<p class="par"></p>
<div class="figure xd21e1369width"><img src="images/p064.png" alt=
"ISIS AND HORUS." width="318" height="660">
<p class="figureHead">ISIS AND HORUS.</p>
<p class="par first">The Egyptians frankly surmounted the effigies of
their Virgin Mother with the figure of a fish, the form of which
suggests the reason. The fish was associated with Isis, representing
the female element in creation. It is associated with the <i lang=
"la">dies Veneris</i> (day of Venus). Friday is fish day, and Friday is
named after Friga, a goddess of the ancient Scandinavians,
Anglo-Saxons, and Germans, corresponding to the Roman Venus. That Roman
Catholics profess to eat fish on Friday by way of abstinence in
commemoration of the crucifixion does not mislead those acquainted with
the antiquity of the symbol.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">With the adoption of the worship of Isis to
Christianity, the crescent moon became a sacred symbol of Mary, who was
often portrayed standing upon one. It was held peculiarly sacred by the
Greek church and a large crescent moon of gold adorned the dome of St.
Sophia at Constantinople. When the city fell in 1453 before the Turkish
arms, the Sultan adopted the crescent as a symbol of his victorious
power and as a humiliation to his Christian enemies, and thus again the
religious significance of the crescent changed, and as an emblem of a
Mohammedan power soon came to be regarded by the forgetful Christians
with horror and a deadly hatred.</p>
<p class="par">The ancient Chaldees believed in a celestial
virgin-mother to whom the erring sinner might appeal, and Shin-moo, the
mother goddess, occupies a conspicuous place in Chinese worship. The
Babylonians and Assyrians worshiped a goddess called Mylitta, whose son
Tammuz is said to have arisen from the dead.</p>
<p class="par">In India they have worshiped for ages Devaki, the mother
of Krishna, and Maya, the mother of Buddha, both of whom are
represented with the infant saviors in their arms. Their statues,
similar to the Christian madonnas, are found in Hindu temples, and
their portraits are always accompanied by halos. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Sochiquetzal, mother of Quetzalcoatl, was worshiped in
Mexico as the mother of their crucified savior. As queen of heaven and
the chaste and immaculate protectress of women, the Greek Hera and her
Roman prototype, Juno, were worshiped by the ancient classical world,
while the virtuous Diana of Ephesus held a similar place in
Ph&oelig;nician mythology.</p>
<p class="par">All the ancient beliefs in the virgin queen of heaven
and her miraculous child probably had more or less effect on the growth
of virgin worship in the Christian church; but it was undoubtedly
Egyptian influence which was most powerful in the adoption of it, just
as it was in regard to the trinitarian dogma. The worship of Isis and
Horus was introduced into Rome during the early days of the empire and
was readily accepted. And with its introduction came those basalt
images of the goddess and her child which have since been adopted by
the Christians as ancient representations of Mary and Jesus, albeit
they are as black as Ethiopians. Many centuries before, the worship of
the Greek goddess Hera had been instituted at Rome under the name of
Juno, and she was especially regarded as the chaste and immaculate
protectress of women. And it was the combination of the worship offered
to these two deities that the Christian church condensed into the
worship of the mother of Jesus, to which it added the attributes of
Diana, making Mary the patroness of chastity as well as fruitfulness!
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>In Dante&rsquo;s day it was customary to invoke
the Virgin Mary at childbirth just as Juno Lucina was invoked by the
pagan ancestors of the Italians.</p>
<p class="par">The worship of the virgin as <i>theotokos</i>, the
mother of god, was promulgated at the general council of Ephesus, which
was called by the Emperor Theodosius II in 431, and, after that date,
and up to the present time, we find this lowly Jewish peasant girl
delineated in all the insignia of royalty and portrayed in the most
beautiful and patrician type of classical beauty.</p>
<p class="par">With the adoration of Mary rose the legend that she,
too, had ascended bodily into heaven and was there crowned by her son
and bidden to sit eternally upon his right hand that she might plead
with him to mitigate the punishments of sinners, thus allowing that the
judgment of this second member of the holy trinity might be fallible,
or at least open to influence.</p>
<p class="par">Having raised the virgin to this immense height, the
natural sequence was to go a step farther and grant to her also
immaculate origin. This idea was first noticed in the eleventh century
and steadily grew until in 1494 Sextus the Fourth officially recognized
it and gave it the solemn sanction of the church, and in July, 1615,
Paul the Fifth instituted the office commemorating her immaculate
conception. Virgin worship has continued to grow and flourish, and even
so late as 1854, Pius the Ninth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68"
href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>issued a bull officially
declaring Mary the &ldquo;Mediatrix&rdquo; between Christ and the
faithful.</p>
<p class="par">Mary is not, however, the only intercessor that stands
between man and his God. There is an immense horde of saints who also
occupy positions of honor about the heavenly throne. These immortal
semi-human beings are created by a decree of the Roman pontiff and
their canonization has often been due to whimsical reasoning. That all
the apostles, martyrs, and early Christian fathers should have been
raised to this holy peerage is not so remarkable; but that such honor
should have been conferred on the wicked, unscrupulous, and vicious
Constantine, and his almost unknown mother Helena; on the powerful and
warlike Charlemagne; and on the ambitious and ungrateful Thomas
&agrave; Becket, seems strange to say the least.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">That this army of saints was originally created to
replace the body of heroes and demi-gods of antiquity cannot be
doubted. The compliance with which the church converted pagan deities
into Christian heroes is perfectly well known, and it is shown in many
ways. Ancient statues were declared to represent newly canonized saints
to whom pagan attributes were unhesitatingly given&mdash;often most
ridiculously. At the temple of Sebona, in Nubia, the Christians
replaced the figure of the old god of the temple, which appeared in a
fresco, by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>that of St. Peter, thus depicting King Rameses the
Second as presenting his offering to the Christian saint! The statue of
Jupiter in St. Peter&rsquo;s at Rome has been declared that of the
erstwhile fisherman, and its original thunderbolts have been replaced
by the keys, which the Christian mythologists have filched from the god
Janus to bestow on their revered patron in accordance with the promise
of <a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2016:19">Matthew
xvi, 19</a>. Rome is full of proofs of this conversion of heathen to
Christian deities. The temple formerly sacred to the Bona Dea was
dedicated to the Virgin Mary; the church of Saint Apollinaris stands on
the spot formerly dedicated to Apollo; and the temple of Mars was given
to St. Martina. The very names of some of the saints have an old
familiar sound&mdash;as St. Baccho, St. Quirinus, St. Romula, St.
Redempta, St. Concordia, St. Nympha, and St. Mercurius.</p>
<p class="par">The Christian symbolism of its heroes has also a
decidedly pagan flavor. The ancient winged lion of the Egyptian
mythology is made to portray St. Mark; the sacred bull denotes St.
Luke; while St. John is generously supplied with both the eagle of Jove
and the hawk&rsquo;s head of Horus.</p>

<p class="par first">The symbolism of that part of the dress of the
priest and nun which conforms to the superimposed portion of the
<i>crux ansata</i> is too plain to need explanation. The idea of the
creative parts and of birth is involved.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The idea of intercession, which is the principal
attribute of all the saints, is also a very ancient religious theory
and probably came with the other dogmas already mentioned from
Alexandria, as we find that the Egyptians believed that some of their
gods&mdash;and particularly the four gods of the
dead&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>acted as mediators with the stern judge Osiris and
attempted to turn aside his wrath and the punishment of sins.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Much akin to the saints, though differing from them in
form and in never having been mortal, are the angels. These beings
combine the wings of the Roman victories with the sweet voices of the
Teutonic elves and the classical sirens, and are in many ways similar
to the famous northern valkyries who wore shirts of swan plumage and
hovered over Scandinavian battlefields to receive the souls of falling
heroes. The Hindu <i>apsaras</i> and Moslem <i>houris</i> belong to the
same family. A few years ago a bitter controversy arose in New York
Episcopal circles as to the sex of these unearthly creatures, some
strenuously advocating their masculinity, while others gallantly
asserted that they were essentially feminine, but the earlier idea was
that they were entirely sexless, combining the characteristic virtues
of both sexes.</p>
<p class="par">Apart from both saints and angels stands another figure
in the Christian mythology&mdash;one, however, that has no actual
counterpart in the ancient faiths. This is Satan. The classical
religious systems had no such conception, their king of the dead being
a gloomy and austere deity without any of the malicious or mischievous
propensities of the more modern devil, and having no designs upon the
welfare of mankind. The medieval conception of the devil was a
grotesque compound of elements derived <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>from all the pagan
mythologies which Christianity superseded. From the sylvan deity Pan he
gets his goat-like body, his horns and cloven hoofs; his lameness was
due to his fall from heaven, in imitation of the fall of the Roman
Vulcan; and his red beard was taken from the lightning god Thor, as was
also his power over the thunderbolts; while his pitchfork is the
converted trident of Neptune.</p>
<p class="par">That much of the absurd fabric of Christianity is built
upon a belief in Satan cannot be denied, for the whole theology is
based upon the necessity of a savior whose death atones for the sins of
mankind, which were consequent upon man&rsquo;s fall from grace through
the machinations of the devil. Had man never fallen, there were no need
of a savior. Had man never been tempted, he would never have fallen,
and in no words was the necessity of a belief in the devil more plainly
set forth than by that most orthodox writer, des Mousseaux, in his
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">Moeurs et Pratiques des Demons</span>,&rdquo;
published in 1852. He says: &ldquo;The Devil is the chief pillar of
Faith. He is one of the grand personages whose life is closely allied
to that of the church, and without his speech, which issued out so
triumphantly from the mouth of the serpent, the fall of man could never
have taken place. Thus, if it were not for him, the Savior, the
Crucified, the Redeemer, would be but the most ridiculous of
supernumeraries and the cross an insult to good sense!&rdquo; In his
preface to &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Les Hauts Phenom&egrave;nes de la
Magie</span>,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72"
name="pb72">72</a>]</span>des Mousseaux repeats this theory: &ldquo;If
magic and spiritualism were both but chimeras, we would have to bid an
eternal farewell to all the rebellious angels now troubling the world;
for thus we would have no more demons down here.... And if we lost our
demons, we would lose our Savior likewise; for, from whom did that
Savior save us? And then there would be no more Redeemer; for, from
whom or what could that Redeemer redeem us? Hence, there would be no
more Christianity.&rdquo; He evidently regards Satan as &ldquo;the
prince of this world&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

<p class="par">The universally accepted belief of Christendom in the
almost absolute power of the devil was the cause of the most awful
persecution of innocence that the world has ever seen. While the
tortures of the heretics by the Inquisition had some cause of a
political as well as ecclesiastical nature, the houndings of those
accused of witchcraft and sorcery had no foundation save in
superstition and gross ignorance. During the Christian era millions of
persons have been destroyed for this crime in conformity to the
command, &ldquo;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2022:18">Ex. xxii,
18</a>). The Roman church recognized and punished the crime; Luther
approved of the burning of witches; the Scotch reformers did likewise,
and the Puritans of New England delighted in the persecution.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">While all religiously orthodox people accept the
narrative of scriptural miracles with unquestioning faith and never
cast a doubt on the greatest improbabilities so long as they are told
of biblical heroes, these very people assign all the seeming
supernatural affairs of post-scriptural times to the devil. Psychical
phenomena which, if performed two thousand years ago by Jesus (such as
the resurrection of Lazarus and the materialization to the Magdalene),
they accept without hesitation, they brand as trickery or a delusion or
Satan, when placed before them by a professed Spiritualist.</p>
<p class="par">Witches and wizards were condemned to horrible deaths by
the medieval church for performing the very identical acts for which
the same church canonized departed saints and instituted offices for
their adoration and worship; and modern Christians smile and sneer
derisively at fortune tellers, but condemn in holy horror as heretics
those who refuse to believe in the foreseeing powers of the ancient
Hebrew prophets.</p>
<p class="par">This Christian devil-worship, for it can be called
little else, crept into Judaism during the Babylonian captivity, and
was originally a recognition of the dual powers of good and evil,
seemingly coequal. By placing Satan in opposition to God, in giving him
eternal life, and endowing him with miraculous powers, and even
allowing him to upset and vanquish the plans of God, Christians have
made Satan equal, if not superior, to the Deity. A Puritan <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>bigot
hanging witches in New England was admitting in the plainest manner his
faith in Satan&rsquo;s power, though it never occurred to him for an
instant that these curious happenings might be attributed to God. The
power of God to perform miracles was then, as now, a matter of the
past. With the Protestant Reformation came the idea that no longer did
God interfere for the benefit of man. In the seventeenth century God
had ceased to work by other than natural agencies. His miraculous
powers, if not lost, were at least suspended. But not so
Satan&mdash;that archfiend was as powerful as ever, if not more so. He
could inflict magical tortures on God&rsquo;s divinely elect and make
them writhe in agony. Pious Cotton Mather had ceased to believe in
divine miracles, but he had no doubt of devilish ones, and it appears
to all students of that dark and shameful period of our history that
the belief was rampant among the majority that God was vanquished and
Satan ruled. Never was belief in the dual principles of good and evil
more surely set forth in ancient Persia than it was in New England by
such harsh, cruel, and bigoted priests as Mather and Parrish.</p>
<p class="par">Today, while all churchmen have grown more liberal, we
still find both in pulpit and pew innumerable believers in the power of
Satan to tempt and force erring humanity into wrong and sinful paths in
miraculous salvation from which by God they have no faith. Today,
instead of earthly and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75"
name="pb75">75</a>]</span>present salvation by the Deity from the
clutches of Satan, the belief seems prevalent that a post-mortem
salvation is more efficacious, and that all that is required for
eternal bliss is belief in the vicarious atonement of the Christ. To
hear our orthodox friends declaim on the powers of Satan almost makes
one ready to believe that God is dead and Satan rules supreme. Such is
the blasphemy of demonic faith.</p>
<p class="par">While Satan, as the arch-enemy, is somewhat similar to
the Persian Ahriman, he is not alone in his wickedness. When
Christianity came into power and supplanted paganism as the Roman state
religion, it immediately debased all of the pagan gods, whom it did not
appropriate to itself as saints, to devils and assigned them
subordinate positions in hell, under command of the great Satan. And
thus, all the beautiful water sprites, sylvan nymphs, spirits of the
air, and other lesser deities, became the associates of wickedness,
and, as such, continued, until a very recent date, to hold sway over
the superstitious imaginations of the majority of Europeans.</p>
<p class="par">The medi&aelig;val church likewise invented the famous
<i>succub&aelig;</i> and <i>incubi</i>, the former demons impersonating
the beautiful nymphs of the old mythology and attacking the virtue of
youths with their seductive arts, while the latter, in imitation of the
ancient satyrs, sought the virginity of unsuspecting maidens; all of
which may readily be learned of in accounts <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>of the
many trials held by &ldquo;the Holy Inquisition,&rdquo; in which such
were condemned as had held intercourse with these demons.</p>
<p class="par">In many cases, women swearing to have had intercourse
with <i>incubi</i> were merely suffering from erotic and nymphomaniac
hallucinations, while others may have found it a convenient excuse for
explaining illicit impregnations. Men, falling under the charms of
women, found it a convenient method for disposing of their loves, after
the infatuation had passed, by declaring them <i>succub&aelig;</i>; and
monks, who had contracted venereal diseases, laid their sufferings to
these same fair demons. In the case of the monks, however, the
<i>succub&aelig;</i> were often of purely hallucinary origin, due to
excessive asceticism together with the suppression of natural desires
and a too faithful conformity to the ordinance of celibacy. Nymphomania
is also prevalent in convents, owing to the unnatural sexual lives led
by the nuns, who either remain truly chaste or abandon themselves to
all sorts of debauchery and perverted lubricities. In former times
these rages of demented women were supposed to have been caused by
possession of demons, which tormented them at the orders of magicians,
and advantage was often taken by the unscrupulous to accuse their
enemies of the crime of sorcery, and thus cause their execution.</p>
<p class="par">One of the most famous of these horrible affairs was
that of Loudin in Poitiers, where the nuns of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>the
Ursuline convent, becoming hysterical and demented, swore themselves
afflicted by Urbain Grandier, a priest of the local church, and despite
the attempts of the rational bailiff and sensible civil lieutenants,
some enemies of the cur&eacute; among the exorcists managed to secure
the arrest, torture, and final burning of the unfortunate man in 1632.
Later, it was discovered that, being personally attractive, handsome
and gallant, Grandier, who never denied his numerous amours, had
incurred the enmity of the Loudin nuns by entirely ignoring their
advances; and hell hath no fury like a woman scorned! These libidinous
women, constantly brooding over disappointment to their fond hopes,
gave such a character of demonic possession to their neurosis that
advantage could be taken of it by rival priests to rid themselves of an
envied enemy. The writhings, gesticulations, convulsions, etc., of
these unfortunate women, combined with the indecency of their actions
on the approach of the exorcists (caused merely by the approach of a
male), were believed by the vulgar to be demonstrations of demonic
possession. Other nuns, seeing the attention and notoriety thus gained
by these sisters, although themselves free from dementia, could not
resist the temptation to simulate its forms and thus acquire renown for
themselves.</p>
<p class="par">Thus arose those horrible demonical scenes which
occupied the attention of all Europe during the seventeenth century and
seemed to point to the possession <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78"
href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>of all convents by devils. And
not convents alone, for other hysterical women, without the walls,
possessed of the same rage for notoriety, took up the character of
demonic possessed and spread the vulgar superstition until it seems
that every woman in Europe who was so unfortunate as to be in any way
afflicted with tendencies to hysteria, neurosis, idiocy, or dementia of
any character whatever, came to be regarded as in the power of a demon,
which in turn was the slave of some magician. And thus, through the
influence of an ignorant and unscrupulous priesthood, a powerful engine
was placed at its disposal for the removal of enemies. Executions for
sorcery continued until their very number and barbarity palled, and the
wearied people were ready for their abolition, when the Reformation
opened and with the accession of power, Protestantism, in this matter,
at least, swayed the masses to reason once more.</p>
<p class="par">Dr. Figuier, in his &ldquo;Histoire du
Merveilleux,&rdquo; explains these demonical possessions as entirely
due to hypnotism, and, ignoring the nymphomaniac theory, asserts that
the exorcists themselves hypnotized the nuns for their own glory and
for purposes of vengeance. One page 234 of volume I he says:
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">L&rsquo;appareil deploy&eacute; par les
exorcistes, leurs adjurations, leurs gestes imposants et
forcen&eacute;s, tenaient lieu des manipulations que nos magnetiseurs
emploient pour endormir leurs sujets. Operant sur des jeunes filles
nerveuses, malades, melancoliques, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79"
href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>les exorcistes produisaient chez
elles une partie des phenom&egrave;nes auxquels donn&eacute; lieu le
<i>somnambulisme artificiel</i>.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The universal belief in evil spirits became a powerful
engine for the advancement of the church. By its use all those who were
inimical to the church could be put out of the way as comrades of
devils, and, furthermore, the theory was advanced that only by the
exorcisms of the church could man be protected from malevolent powers.
Holy water, signs of the cross, repetitions of the name of Mary had
full power to annul all the machinations of the demons, but only in the
hands of the true believers was this efficacious. To preserve one from
the dangers of demonic spite, absolute orthodoxy was essential, and
thus a great premium was imposed upon strict adherence to the church.
Thus was gross superstition a most powerful factor in the growth and
spread of Christianity. According to Lecky: &ldquo;There was scarcely a
village or a church that had not, at some time, been the scene of
supernatural interposition. The powers of light and the powers of
darkness were regarded as visibly struggling for the mastery. Saintly
miracles, supernatural cures, startling judgments, visions, prophecies,
and prodigies of every order, attested the activity of the one, while
witchcraft and magic, with all their attendant horrors, were the
visible manifestations of the other.... Tens of thousands of victims
perished by the most agonizing and protracted <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>torments, without exciting the slightest
compassion.... Nations that were separated by position, by interests,
and by character, on this question were united.&rdquo; And the germ of
all this evil lay in the very foundation of Christianity&mdash;the
faith held in supernatural agencies.</p>
<p class="par">The belief in the supernatural agency in the temptation
of Eve, the temptations of Jesus, the possibility of the miraculous
conception, and the miracles of Christ, were but stepping-stones to
faith in innumerable invisible but potent powers. One who can
conscientiously believe in the supernatural as found between the covers
of the Bible can, by but a slight stretch of the imagination, believe
any preposterous tale that is woven about a supernatural agency. If one
can believe a woman can conceive without contact with semen, one can
believe some old woman can dry up his cow. If one can believe that
Jesus actually raised Lazarus from the dead, one can believe that a man
can kill him by sticking pins in a wax effigy. If one can believe that
Elijah ascended to heaven in a fiery chariot, one can believe that
Goody Jones rode a broomstick through the air. If one can believe that
the Christ was actually tempted by the devil, one can believe in
<i>succub&aelig;</i> and <i>incubi</i>. It is all a matter of logical
reasoning. As soon as a Christian&rsquo;s intellectual powers develop
to a point where he can find no place for the miraculous in the world
about him, he begins to doubt that which was in the world <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>before
him; but, regarding theological tales, he either places them in another
category or ignores them, unless faced with them, when he crawls and
calls them &ldquo;sacred mysteries.&rdquo; That an old woman can sour
his milk or kill his child by the evil eye he does not believe, for
reason has taught him otherwise. And for the same reason he would not
believe his daughter if she told him she was pregnant with a miraculous
child. He did not believe Josephine Woodbury when she made a similar
statement in Boston a few years ago. But he does believe it of Mary,
because it is a &ldquo;holy mystery,&rdquo; and is in another category.
He has inherited his faith from a long line of orthodox ancestors, and
he has never stopped to consider it by the light of pure reason. It is
fortunate for the dogma of the virgin birth that it took root when
people believed such things, otherwise Mary would have been adorned
with the scarlet letter.</p>

<p class="par">Feasts, fasts and elaborate ceremonials were important
features of the most ancient worships, and it is not, therefore,
strange to find somewhat modified adaptations of them in the Christian
church. For, wherever Christianity wandered and found firmly implanted
religious theories and customs, it immediately gave them new
significations and accepted them, until finally the greater part of
paganism was gathered from all parts of the civilized world and
amalgamated into one strong theological organization. Finding
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>in almost every nation a festival at the winter
solstice, in commemoration of the accouchement of the celestial, virgin
queen of heaven, and the birth of the sun-god, the Christian fathers
decided to adopt the 25th of December as the natal day of their
Christ.</p>
<p class="par">Mithras, Osiris, Horus, Bacchus, Adonis and Buddha were
all said to have been born on this day, and it is the date of one of
the greatest religious festivals of India, during which the people
decorate their houses with garlands and make presents to relatives and
friends; a custom adopted by the Christians in much the same manner as
was that of the ancient German yule-log, burned in honor of the
sun-god.</p>

<p class="par first">The winter solstice was also the time of the great
Scandinavian festival in honor of Frey, son of Odin and Frigga, who was
supposed to have been born at this time. The Jews, likewise, have a
feast beginning on the 25th of December, which lasts eight days, and is
in memory of the victory of the Maccabees over the Greeks. It is called
the feast of Hanuca.</p>
<p class="par">A great annual festival, called the &ldquo;feast of
lamps,&rdquo; was held by the Egyptians in the early part of the year
in honor of the goddess Neith, during which lamps of oil were burned
all night before the houses. This festival was renamed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>Candlemas or the &ldquo;purification of the
virgin,&rdquo; and was adopted by the Christian church.</p>
<p class="par">The ancient pagan inhabitants of Europe annually
celebrated a spring festival which began with a week&rsquo;s indulgence
in all kinds of sports and was called the <i>carne-vale</i>, or taking
farewell of meat, because a fast of forty days immediately followed. In
Germany this was held in honor of the Saxon goddess Hertha, or Ostara,
or Eostre&mdash;as you may prefer to call her&mdash;whose name was
adopted as Easter by the Christians as the name to be applied to the
end of their lenten period. Among the Syrians it was the custom to
celebrate an elaborate festival at the time of the spring equinox in
honor of the glorious Adonis, beloved of the great goddess Astarte.
This worship was later introduced into Greece, whence it traveled to
Rome with the majority of Grecian mythological theories. It was later
introduced into Egypt, where it was annually celebrated at Alexandria,
the cradle of Christianity, until the latter part of the fourth
century, when a Christian significance was given it.</p>
<p class="par">The myth of Adonis is too well known to need repetition
here, and its parallel to that of the Christ is readily seen. The
ceremonies now held in Rome at Easter are but slightly different from
those held there at the same time of year centuries ago. This
similarity was explained away by the assertion of the Christian fathers
&ldquo;that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>a long time before there were Christians in
existence, the devil had taken pleasure to have their future mysteries
and ceremonies copied by <i>his</i> worshipers&rdquo;&mdash;a very
simple and satisfactory explanation!</p>
<p class="par">That Easter is in reality an astronomical festival in
honor of the sun-god seems conclusive from the fact that it occurs on
no settled date, but takes place on the first Sunday after the first
full moon after the passing of the vernal equinox, which, for
convenience, is fixed at March 21.</p>
<p class="par">Among the many Christian fasts of pagan origin none is
more familiar to all than the weekly Friday abstinence from meat. Under
the old mythology, Friday, the <i lang="la">dies veneris</i>, was
sacred to Venus, and on that day the devout worshipers of this charming
goddess ate nothing but fish, as all the &ldquo;finny tribe&rdquo; were
sacred to her, and considered proper diet for those that worshiped at
her shrine.</p>
<p class="par">When the Bishop of Rome assumed the power and dignity of
head of the western church, he also assumed all the prerogatives of the
ancient <i lang="la">pontifex maximus</i> (who was supposed to be the
direct physical communication between the people and the deities), and
many of the attributes of the emperors. He adopted the gorgeous
vestments of the ancient high priest and even stretched forth a foot to
be kissed, as Heliogabalus had done. He considered himself capable
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>of raising such as he saw fit to semi-divine
honors by canonization, just as the emperors had raised altars to their
favorites, and he claimed precedence over every monarch of the earth,
just as they also had done. But the Roman pontiff is not unique in his
position of viceroy of the deity. The grand lama of Thibet is
considered as the representative of Buddha and has the power of
dispensing divine blessings on whomsoever he will. Taoism also has a
pope who resides on the Lung-h&ucirc; mountain, in the department of
Kwang-hsi, who bears the surname Chang and is called &ldquo;Heavenly
Master.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The best known rites of the Christian church are
probably those of baptism, confession and communion, with which are
associated the ideas of purification, prayer and
transubstantiation.</p>
<p class="par">The rite of baptism, like all ideas which refer to the
purification of sin by water, is a most ancient one. Rivers, as sources
of purification, were at an early date invested with a sacred
character, and every great river was supposed to be permeated with a
divine essence and its waters were believed to cleanse from all mortal
guilt and contamination. The Ganges and the Jordan are well known
examples of this faith, and vases of Ganges water are to be found in
almost every dwelling in India for religious purposes. In Mongolia and
Thibet children are named by the priests, who immerse them in holy
water while <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>reading a prescribed prayer, after which the name
is bestowed. Baptism preceded initiation into the mysteries of both the
Egyptian Isis and the Persian Mithras, and was held to be the means of
regeneration and of remission of sins.</p>
<p class="par">Tertullian, noticing the great similarity between the
Christian and pagan baptisms, na&iuml;vely remarked that the devil
&ldquo;baptizes some, of course, such as believe in him and are
faithful to him; he promises expiation of sins from the bath, and, if
my memory of Mithras serves me still, in this rite he signs his
soldiers on their foreheads.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Much akin to baptism is the general use by the Christian
church of so-called holy water, which is ascribed to Pope Alexander the
First, who ruled during the first century. This pontiff probably did
little more than officially to condone, by his papal sanction, the very
general use of lustral water, which the Romans had inherited from their
pagan ancestors; for lustral water was always kept in vases at the
entrance of the Roman temples, that those passing in and out might
sprinkle themselves with it; and the priests used a sprinkling brush
called the <i lang="la">aspersorium</i> with which they threw the
purifying water over their congregations, in the same manner as modern
priests use the hyssop. The druids gave, or sprinkled upon, the
worshipers water in which mistletoe had been immersed or steeped.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Similar to the idea of purification by baptism is that
of purification by confession and prayer. The idea involved in
confession is that the declaration of the crime relieves the conscience
of its criminality. In Iceland and among the Scandinavian and Teutonic
peoples in general, murder ceased to be a crime when the slayer had
declared himself guilty. Among the Jews confession was practiced, the
purpose of its institution being that the priest might judge of the
sacrifice required for the expiation of the sin committed, and, also,
that every crime might be rehearsed over the scapegoat. The Peruvians
confessed their sins to their priests with the exception of the Incas,
who confessed to the sun. At the famous Samothracian mysteries a priest
was especially charged with hearing the confessions of great criminals
and with granting them absolution.</p>
<p class="par">Among Protestant Christians confession is often made
directly to the supreme deity in the form of prayer, which, like most
other religious practices, is an eminently pagan custom. The Assyrians,
Babylonians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and most other ancient peoples
offered sacrifices on the altars of their gods to propitiate them, and
accompanied these offerings with prayers. Today, instead of presenting
wines and viands to his god, the devout Christian offers verbal
expressions of a contrite spirit or, more <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>often, asks a favor. He
demands, begs, or advises through this method, according to his own
nature and disposition.</p>
<p class="par">The expression used in modern orthodox Protestant
prayers, &ldquo;through our Lord, Jesus Christ,&rdquo; is merely the
concrete expression of the idea of mediation. The great supreme God was
looked upon by most nations of antiquity as being too great, too
sublime, too holy, to be addressed directly; and, in this lofty
conception of the deity, they prayed for favors to mediators whom they
created to request boons from the real ruler of heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="par">Among the Hindus, supplications were addressed to the
various apotheosized incarnations of Vishnu, rather than to the great
Brahma; the Greeks made supplication to numerous lesser gods, rather
than to Zeus; Persians addressed Mithras instead of Ormuzd; and the
modern Romanist kneels to saints and martyrs, or Jesus or his mother,
at whose shrines they place offerings which are bribes for favors; but
almost never do they immediately supplicate the supreme God. In this
they are certainly less blasphemous than their Protestant fellows, who
do not hesitate to talk familiarly to God of the most trivial
affairs.</p>
<p class="par">Belief in the efficacy of prayer is an absurdity which
owes its origin to a hereditary trait of humanity, descended through a
long line of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>superstitious ancestors. Primitive man prayed to
his dead fathers for their good will, believing them more powerful in
their post mortem state than during life. The ancients offered prayers
at the shrines of their various gods and, among all nations, from time
immemorial, deities have been supplicated to bestow gifts and avert
misfortunes. The overcharged mind of the superstitious has ever found
relief in expressing its troubles to the imaginary beings on whom it
has bestowed superhuman attributes. All over the world, in all
languages, have arisen various petitions to the deities, and still do
they continue to arise. Savages pray to their idols, Moslems crouch
facing Mecca to pray to Allah, Hindus pray to the avatars of Vishnu,
and all Christendom besieges the throne of God in constant
supplication.</p>

Vain repetitions! The material universe is governed by immutable laws
which all the breath in creation wasted in prayer cannot in any way
affect; while such spiritual benefits as morality, character and virtue
&ldquo;are equally dependent on the invariable laws of cause and

most common, as well as the most absurd, that are daily offered. Sin is
the breaking of a material or moral law, and no law can be broken
without the transgressor&rsquo;s incurring the penalty. Is it not
absurd of the church to preach the immutable justice of God, and at the

<p class="par">Communion, or union with the deity, is an idea of great
antiquity and has been common to all religions; although the methods
practiced are numerous and varied. The more common mode, however, is by
the consumption of consecrated foods and drinks, with the idea that
these have acquired (by the act of consecration) a divine character of
which the communicant becomes a partaker through their reception. The
dogma of the eucharist was instituted many centuries before the
Christian era and was believed in by the ancient Egyptians (from whom
the Christians probably received it through the Alexandrian school),
who, at the time of the celebration of the resurrection of Osiris, ate
a sacred wafer, which, after consecration by a priest, was declared the
flesh of the god. In ancient Greece, bread was worshiped as Ceres and
wine as Bacchus; and, when the devout ate the bread and drank the wine,
they claimed they were eating the flesh and drinking the blood of their
deities. The ancient Mexicans used bread of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>corn
meal mixed with blood, which, after, having been consecrated by the
priests, was given to the people to eat as the flesh of Quetzalcoatl,
much to the surprise and horror of the first Spanish missionaries, who
ascribed it to mockery of their holy eucharist due to Satan.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The primal origin of the eucharist probably
occurred far back in the period of universal anthropophagy. Most savage
and semi-savage peoples have practiced cannibalism because they
believed that by eating the flesh of the dead they gained the qualities
of the deceased. Just as some Africans eat tiger to become brave,
savages ate their courageous foes to attain their virtues. Following
this same idea further, the belief was established that by consuming
the flesh of a god, supernatural powers might be acquired. Thus the
early Christian missionaries to the New World found such customs in
Peru and Mexico.</p>
<p class="par">Father Acosta described one of these festivals which
occurred annually each May in Mexico, wherein the statue of a god was
made of dough, and &ldquo;killed&rdquo; by an arrow in the hand of a
priest. The god was then broken in pieces which by means of
&ldquo;certain ceremonies ... were blessed and consecrated for the
flesh and bones of this idoll.&rdquo; These pieces the priest gave
&ldquo;to the people in manner of a communion who received <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>it with
such feare, and reverence, as it was an admirable thing, saying that
they did eate the flesh and bones of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Likewise came the idea that sacrifices to the gods in
some way attained godlike characteristics, and so the Guatemalan
priests ate the bodies of the sacrificed.</p>
<p class="par"></p>

<p class="figureHead">A BUDDHIST &ldquo;TEMPTATION.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The words of the modern Roman priest, &ldquo;hoc est
corpus meum,&rdquo; which are supposed, by some magical influence, to
cause the actual transubstantiation in the celebration of the
eucharist, remind one forcibly of the dotting of the memorial Chinese
tablet by a mandarin, by which official act the spirit of the departed,
to whom it is dedicated, is presumed to take up residence in the new
abode.</p>
<p class="par">As a logical deduction from a given hypothesis, any
Roman priest is greater than the virgin. She conceived God but once,
while the priest may through his mass create the body of the Christ
whenever he so desires. Every time a priest performs this function he
is the father of God.</p>
<p class="par">However, in spite of the absurdity of the practice, to
deprive the communion of the real presence is to make it a senseless
and useless ceremony. While the communicants believe in the efficacy of
the wafer as the actual body, there is reason for absorbing it, as they
thus unite themselves with the actual spirit of the Christ. But
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>the moment this dogma is rejected, the rite
becomes futile, and nothing is more ridiculous than its perpetuation in
the Protestant churches. The quibble that it is performed in memory of
Jesus is a fallacy. In Unitarian churches it is an arrant absurdity
(one that is retained in many cases simply because the old historical
churches of that denomination have inherited fine old communion plate
which is proudly displayed), and one can only respect and admire Ralph
Waldo Emerson&rsquo;s stand in the matter, when he preferred to
relinquish his remunerative and honorable pastorate in the Second
Church of Boston (the only pulpit he ever filled) rather than celebrate
this anachronistic and indefensible rite.</p>
<p class="par">Jerome carried his reverence for the Eucharistic
bread<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1687src" href="#xd21e1687" name=
"xd21e1687src">1</a> so far that he considered that the table on which
it was consecrated, together with the cloth in which it was wrapped,
and the other utensils connected with its service, were to be worshiped
with equal respect as that given the body and blood of the Savior. This
theory led to the consecration of altars, which by a decree of the
Council of Epaone, in 517, in imitation of the Jewish and pagan
sacrificial altars, were ordered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94"
href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>to be of stone, which material
had been originally chosen as the most suitable material for the
execution of the sacrifices, whose blood should flow over it, without
danger of absorption.</p>
<p class="par">Another of the ancient pagan ideas which took a strong
hold upon Christianity and rose to an abnormal power during the middle
ages was that of monasticism with its accompanying asceticism. There is
scarcely a religion of ancient and modern times that does not recognize
asceticism as an element of its system. Buddha taught his disciples a
religion of abstinence, and, among the Buddhists, there are ordained
and tonsured priests, living in monasteries under vows of celibacy,
while there are similar asylums for women. Brahmanism also has its
orders of ascetics and Hinduism has its fakirs. Fasting and self-denial
were observances required by the Greeks of those who desired initiation
into the mysteries; the Jews observed many fasts; and the Egyptian
priests passed their novitiate in the deserts engaged in prayer and
living in caves. Like many other Christian customs, the monastic habit
probably came from Egypt, and it was considered by Gibbon to have had a
potent influence on the fall of the western empire, in that it removed
from active and useful life so many able-bodied men and women.

it and the Latin in the eleventh century, but the latter finally

Christianity</span>.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Having now shown that there is nothing new in
Christianity; nothing in which it differs essentially from the older
faiths; having shown that it brought no new ideas in its dogmas,
practices, or morality, but a few words are necessary to explain its
marvelous growth and rapid acceptance. Christianity grew so rapidly,
and was adopted so readily in many parts of the world simply because it
was so cosmopolitan and elastic. It went forth to proselyte in a very
conciliatory manner, embracing and absorbing every deeply rooted
theological idea and custom which obstructed its path, and, in every
way, exerting itself to propitiate its converts. And it was not until
it became strong and powerful and was well supported by fanatical
adherents that it dared to assume the r&ocirc;le of conqueror. Then,
when the period of its strength was full, its tone changed and, strong
in self-confidence, Christianity became militant and strode forth in
armor to vanquish with the sword and fill the world with blood.</p>
<p class="par">One of the reasons for the rapid acceptance of
Christianity among the Romans and its remarkable growth in their
dependencies was that for centuries the people had ceased to take their
religion seriously. The vulgar masses, undoubtedly then as now, and at
all times, unthinkingly swallowed all that was taught them of their
deities, but the writings <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href=
"#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>of cultivated men show clearly that
for centuries the worship and reverence of their ancestral gods had but
slight influence upon their ethical ideas.</p>
<p class="par">Lucretius (95&ndash;52 B. C.), the exponent of the
Epicurean doctrines, regarded the gods as the creations of human fear.
Ennius (239&ndash;169 B. C.) translated and expounded the writings of
Euhemerus (316 B. C.), wherein it was claimed that all the ancient
myths were historical events, that the gods were originally kings who
were accorded post mortem worship by their grateful subjects. The
Stoics regarded the gods as personifications of the different
attributes of nature. Cicero adopted the Platonic conception of the
deity as mind freed from all taint of matter, while Ovid made the gods
ridiculous in his mocking &ldquo;Metamorphoses,&rdquo; and, in his
lascivious descriptions of their amours, degraded them forever as
ethical models. Horace likewise mocked them.</p>
<p class="par">The glorious military conquests of the Roman arms in
Asia and Africa brought the soldiers into contact with alien religions,
and the germs instilled in the minds of the armies spread among all the
peoples of Rome&rsquo;s domains, upon their return. Likewise the
ever-increasing influx of foreigners, bringing with them their native
gods and theological systems, had more or less influence, while the
apotheoses of the emperors gave a powerful impetus to the degradation
of the ancient faith. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97"
name="pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The vulgar clung to their ancient shrines and the
cultured sneered at them for so doing. They bent the knee in public and
they laughed mockingly in private. In such a state was the religion of
Rome when the first Christians began to proselyte; and on such fertile
ground, amid the ruins of an ancient faith, the seed readily took root
and rapidly spread out. Any other faith, supported by sturdy,
conscientious and indomitable missionaries, would have done the same.
The old faith was dead and the time was ripe for something new and
vigorous.</p>
<p class="par">As the civilized world was then under one powerful
government, which allowed no political discord within its borders and
which granted absolute religious freedom, the Christian missionaries
could travel in safety from one province to another and, without fear
of molestation, could propagate their doctrines among the people
through the media of the Greek and Latin tongues, which were universal
throughout the empire. Early Christianity was merely a sect of Judaism,
and as the Jews were scattered all through the Roman provinces, every
Jewish settlement having its synagogue which the Christian missionaries
visited in order to preach their message, &ldquo;the new religion,
which was undertaken in the name of the God of Abraham, and Moses,
found a sphere already prepared for itself.&rdquo; The new sect was
naturally welcomed by the Roman Jews, as it was a purely national
religion, founded upon the teachings of a Jewish peasant for the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>Jewish people. There is nothing in the gospels
which portrays Jesus as anything other than a prophet to his own
nation. While his moral doctrines, like all ethical principles, are
applicable to all races, he was ignorant of all peoples save his own,
and it was to them alone that he preached, proclaiming his messiahship
for them only. He was content to remain within the boundaries of his
own country and expressed no wish nor desire to visit other lands. Had
it remained as Jesus desired, Christianity would never have been
separated from Judaism. It was owing to the direct disobedience of
Peter and Paul in this particular, that Christianity spread among the
gentiles (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2014:46">Acts xiv,

thought <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>of a universal mission in all this. His mission
and sacrifice were for his own nation, and, as Paul writes to Titus, he
&ldquo;gave himself that he might purify unto himself a peculiar
people&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Tit%202:14">Tit. ii,
14</a>).</p>
<p class="par">Thinking probably of the political strife which his
messiahship would cause, Jesus said, &ldquo;I came not to bring peace,
but a sword&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2010:34">Matt. x,

"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%202:14">Luke ii,
14</a>). &ldquo;The Church of Rome has shed more innocent blood than
any other institution that ever existed among mankind,&rdquo; says
Lecky in his &ldquo;Rationalism in Europe&rdquo; (vol. ii, p. 40). The
Holy Office in Spain burned over 31,000 persons and condemned to
punishment hardly less severe 290,000. During the reign of Charles the
Fifth 50,000 heretics were executed in the Netherlands and on February
16, 1508, the Holy Office condemned all the inhabitants, numbering
3,000,000 of people, to death as heretics, and Philip the Second
confirmed the decree and ordered its instant execution.</p>
<p class="par">The whole history of Christianity, in all its forms,
reeks with blood and smells to heaven with carrion. In the first
centuries Christians persecuted pagans or, divided among themselves,
persecuted each other as heretics. Later arose the feuds of orthodox
and Arian, then came a united Christendom against Islam, followed by
Protestant wars. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100"
name="pb100">100</a>]</span>In these Catholics murdered, pillaged, and
devastated Protestants and burned and tortured them as heretics by
ecclesiastical tribunals; Protestants persecuted and executed Catholics
and, divided among themselves, persecuted one another. In the sixteenth
century Anglican Episcopalians persecuted Catholics and Nonconformists.
In the seventeenth century Puritans persecuted Catholics,
Episcopalians, and Quakers, and so on. The whole history of this
religion is a long narration of blasphemous and degrading theories
propagated by violence, hypocrisy and crime. Christian charity is a
delusion which is found only among the persecuted, who, the instant the
scale turns, become the ruling faction, forget its meaning, and hasten
to avenge their sufferings in persecutions. No other religion has so
bloody a history as Christianity. The old heathen religions went calmly
on their way, indifferent to one another and showing the most perfect
toleration. Rival gods of rival nations were worshiped in temples side
by side, without conflict or ill feeling. Buddhists and Brahmins mildly
flourish in proximity. But Christians who believe that the Christ was
sacrificed for love of humanity, that their gospel is one of love,
peace, and good will, vie with one another to outstrip the ferocity of
wild beasts.</p>
<p class="par">While many students believe that Jesus was a purely
mythical being, without actual existence save in the brains of
religious Christians, I see no reason <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb101" href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>to doubt that a
certain Jewish rabbi may have come out of the rebellious province of
Galilee about the time of Herod. Such messiahs had come before him and
such have succeeded him. Some of the messiahs subsequent to Jesus were:
one who appeared in Persia in 1138, another in Arabia in 1167, and one
in Moravia at the close of the twelfth century. Eldavid proclaimed
himself messiah in Persia in 1199, Sabathai Tzevi assumed the title of
&ldquo;King of Kings&rdquo; in 1666 and was executed at Constantinople
by the Sultan. So late as 1829 there appeared in India the
eight-year-old son of a peasant who was a wonderful serpent charmer and
was called Marayum Powar. It was an ancient belief that the ability to
handle serpents unharmed was a proof that one had become perfectly
holy&mdash;absorbed in God! Therefore, numerous people came to believe
Powar a god and in ten months ten thousand followers were about him,
baptizing and performing miraculous cures&mdash;and his cult seemed
well on the road to establishment when, over-confident of his power, he
was bitten by a serpent and died. His followers, after vainly awaiting
his resurrection, dispersed.</p>
<p class="par">That Jesus&rsquo; whole career is lost in encircling
myth is no proof that the original figure never existed. There is
plenty of historical evidence to show that the central portion of
Europe was once ruled by a king named Karl, and we do not doubt this
simply because a great cloud of myths has been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>gathered about the name of St. Charlemagne, any
more than we feel bound to believe that because he once lived he must
now necessarily exist, sleeping in a mountain, until it shall be
necessary for him to spring forth and save the German fatherland.</p>
<p class="par">One set of students assert that the Christ was merely
the personification of vegetable life, claiming that his death and
resurrection typify the death and revivification of vegetation. Others
hold that he is the modern phase of the eternal sun-god. To sustain
this hypothesis the following allegorical interpretation of his
supposed career is offered as an explanation. He was born on the early
dawn of the twenty-fifth day of December, the day on which commences
the sun&rsquo;s apparent revolution around the earth; his birth was
announced by the brilliant morning star; his virgin mother was the pure
and beautiful dawn; his temptation was his struggle with the adverse
clouds which he dispersed; his trial, execution, and death were
emblematic of the solar decline and crucifixion at the beginning of
winter; his descent into hell was typical of the three days of the
winter solstice; and his resurrection and ascension refer to the return
of the sun after its seeming extinction.</p>
<p class="par">I have now shown that among the great majority of the
nations of antiquity, no matter as to how they may have differed in the
details, all held one general idea of faith in a savior-mediator
between man and the supreme deity. Some such medium <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>seemed necessary to them, for they had not
reached that intellectual plane on which one feels able to hold direct
communication with the creator. Modern Christianity, in all its forms,
still panders to this ancient superstition that man must needs have an
agent between himself and his God. He must have an intercessor between
his weakness and God&rsquo;s power&mdash;and vengeance.</p>
<p class="par">But when the human mind is freed from superstition and
men learn that right living and a clean ethical code is all that is
required, then they will cease to bow, either physically or mentally,
to any humanly invented mediator, and their enlarged ideas of the
justice of the supreme deity will prohibit any belief in impossible
demi-gods. However, for the majority, that happy time of emancipation
is still in the distant future, and, until its dawn lightens the
general intelligence, men will continue to adore and supplicate the
mediator whom inheritance and environment have taught them to revere,
as Krishna, Buddha, Mithras, or the Christ, as the case may be.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
